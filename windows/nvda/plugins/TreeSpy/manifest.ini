summary = Tree Spy. Inspect the object Hierarchy of an application
description = """
This global plugin provides a means to view the NVDA object hierarchy of the foreground application.
To open the TreeSpy press NVDA+shift+o.
A window appears showing a tree view with the label of each node set to the
windowClassName of the specific NVDA object.  A reference to the NVDA object is contained in
each tree-view node.
The root node of the tree is the foreground object at the time of pressing the hotkey, similar to the
'fg' snap-shot variable in the NVDA Python console.

It also shows the .windowControlID, .name, .value, .role and the states of each object.
