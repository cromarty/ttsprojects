Installation
============

After unpacking the .tar.gz file cd to where it is unpacked and:

 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Uninstalling
============

cd to the place where the .tar.gz was unpacked and where you earlier ran the installation process and:

 make uninstall

Installation from github
=====================

If installing from git, you will have to run one extra step.

This is because getting the installation files from git does not preserve the date stamps of the 
files which causes the make process to re-run the configure.

This is the sequence:

 ./configure
 ./fix-timestamps.sh
 make
 sudo make install

Uninstallation is not different for an installation made from git.
