## Emacspeak

Adaptation of the default espeak Emacspeak server to work with my libilctts 
OMX code library.

The piespeak file in this directory is a tcl script which equates to the 
espeak script in the servers/ directory of Emacspeak installations.

The linux-piespeak/ directory contains an adaptation of the tclespeak.cpp 
source file, called tclpiespeak.cpp.
