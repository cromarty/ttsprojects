============

Before installing piespeakup you need to install the library libilctts.

You will need espeak installed. Some Linux distributions, like Raspbian, separate the development files and the 
executable of espeak into two different packages.

Installation from Archive
-------------------------

If you are installing from a .tar.gz archive which you downloaded. After cding to the directory into which you 
unpacked the archive:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

After which you will need to reboot for the speakup_soft module to be loaded.

Installation from github
------------------------

If you have grabbed the files from github you will need to perform one extra step, because git does not preserve 
file timestamps:

	./configure
	./fix-timestamps.sh
	make
	sudo make install

You will now need to reboot.
