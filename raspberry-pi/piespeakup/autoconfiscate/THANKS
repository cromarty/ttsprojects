Thanks
======

Thanks go to Gregory Osborne who helped by writing static install scripts which we used to install piespeakup on 
either Raspbian or Arch, detecting which in the script.

Not necessary after introduction of autotools build.

And thanks to Rill from the raspberry-vi email list for helping to test the autotools build on Arch.
