TODO
====

* Possibly reduce the size of the ringbuffer.  Bigger than it needs to be at the moment.
* Make tweaking of latency constants easier than recompiling each time.
* Check for memory leaks. Rill reports failure after several days. Possibly a bug in OpenMAX IL.
* Get out more
* Eat less cheese
