## Double-talk Manual

The file speech_manual.txt is a text copy of the original Double-Talk hardware 
speech-synthesiser manual.  It contains information which is useful for decoding the protocol used 
by SpeakUp.

The SpeakUp soft-synth kernel module, which generates /dev/softsynth uses a sub-set of the 
Double-Talk commands.

Saved here for posterity and in case I ever need to know anything about the protocol used by the 
speakup screen-reader.
