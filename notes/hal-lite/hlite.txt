Customising Hal Lite and Writing your own Environment Files.

1. -  Starting to Read the Screen

This lesson gives you a basic introduction to reading the screen.


1.1 A note about Hal Lite
 
Hal Lite is the program that looks after the speech synthesiser.  It will be 
working away all the time that the computer is switched on and will send data 
out to the synthesiser to be spoken.  Hal Lite is a sophisticated program, 
and later on you will learn about the many ways that Hal Lite can be set up 
to tell you just what you want to know, and no more.  However, to start with, 
Hal Lite will read out to you every letter, number or punctuation mark that 
you type in.

1.2 Starting screen reading
 
Depress the key called <ALT> and whilst it is depressed tap the letter <J> 
key.  The computer will say "reading".  You are no longer in "live" mode but 
in the reading mode.  This means that the keys on the keyboard all have 
different meanings.  Let's try a few.

The letter <T> key now means go to the top left hand corner of the screen and 
the letter <L> key stands for "read a line".  So try pressing first the letter 
<T> and then the <L> key.  Hal Lite will then make the speech synthesiser 
read the top line of the screen which is the "Welcome" message.  Try it again.  
Now to read some more lines of text.  Use the <T> and <L> keys again but this 
time press <L> over and over again and it will read the lines as it proceeds 
down the screen.

Note:   If you should accidentally press the letter <P> key whilst in reading 
mode you will find you have entered the parameter menu which will be explained 
later in the manual.  In the meantime, to get out of the parameter menu and 
back into reading mode press the <ESC> key.
 
Now, to get out of reading mode, simply hit the <ENTER> key and the computer 
will say "exit" and you are back in live mode again.  One important tip that 
you might find useful at this stage is the command to mute the synthesiser.  
Simply hold down the <ALT> key and whilst it is depressed tap the letter <M>.  
The synthesiser will immediately stop what it is saying.

2. -  More Screen Reading

This lesson takes you through a more comprehensive list of Hal Lite's reading 
commands and discusses how Hal Lite can be made to read text of different 
colours.

2.1 Reading lines, words and characters
 
Enter reading mode as before (depress the <ALT> key and tap the <J> key).  
Now use the <T> key to place the reading cursor in the top left hand corner 
of the screen. The cursor is a small marker which shows sighted users where 
they are on the screen.  The shape of the cursor is not important - they come 
in all shapes, sizes and even colours.  The important concept is that it marks 
our position on the screen.  The top left hand corner of the screen is the 
"home" position of the cursor from which everything else is measured.  So now 
the cursor is in column one and row one.  You can check this if you like by 
pressing the <X> and <Y> keys, both should say "one". 

As you move the cursor along the line the value of X will increase, and as 
you move down the screen the value of Y will increase.

Now let's read the top line "Welcome to lesson 1" but just one word at a time.  
Press the letter <R> key for "read a word".  Repeat this and you will be able 
to read the whole screen just one word at a time.  As you do this hit the <X> 
and <Y> keys from time to time so as to monitor your position on the screen.
 
Suppose that you read a word that you cannot quite understand because the 
speech synthesiser has not got it quite right?  Simply go back to the start 
of the word using the <Q> key and step through the word one character at a 
time with the <C> key.  If you still cannot understand you can make the 
computer spell out the word phonetically, that is using the alpha, bravo, 
charlie system.  Try this now by reading a word with the <R> key then use Q 
to go back to the start of the word.  Now press down the <ALT> key and tap 
the letter <I> key.  The first letter of the word will be spoken.  Now keep 
the <ALT> key depressed and tap the letter <I> key a second time.  The 
computer will give you the phonetic equivalent of the letter.  Now move along 
one character using the <C> key and repeat the sequence.

There are a few other relevant key meanings that you can experiment with and 
we finish this first part of the lesson with a list of these commands.  Again 
we have used a form of shorthand to say "keep the ALT key depressed and tap 
the letter I key".  This is simply written:

<ALT>  and  <I>.

Similarly if the command uses the control key, instead of writing "depress 
the control key and whilst it is depressed tap the letter A key", we simply 
write:
<CTRL> and <A>

Again we hope that this form of shorthand makes reading the tutor easier.  
Here is the list:

<L>
read a line at a time

<R>
read a word at a time

<C>
read a character at a time

<S>
moves the reading cursor to the start of the line

<E>
moves the reading cursor to the end of the line

<U>
moves the reading cursor up one line

<D>
moves the reading cursor down one line

<T>
moves the reading cursor to the top of the screen

<B>
moves the reading cursor to the  bottom of the line

<H>
moves the reading cursor to its live mode position i.e. where it was

<X>
reads the cursor position as a column number

<Y>
reads the cursor position as a row number

<.>
moves the cursor one character but without speaking it

<,>
moves the cursor back one character but without speaking it

<ALT> and <O>
pressed once reads the word that the cursor is on, pressed a second time will 
spell that word

<ALT> and <L>
reads the line that the cursor is on

<ALT> and <K>
reads the line that the cursor is on up to the cursor position 

<ALT> and <T>
reads current time

<ALT> and <D>
reads current date

<ALT> and <I>
pressed once reads the character that the cursor is on, pressed a second time 
will read that character

<ALT> and <G>
reads row and column position (like <X> and <Y>

<ENTER>
exits reading mode and returns the cursor to its original position 

<CTRL> and <M>
an identical alternative to return above

The shifted point on the numeric keypad offers a sentence reading facility 
which enables you to read a whole screen of text a sentence at a time 
whenever shifted point is depressed.  For more information on special numeric 
keypad commands see section 6.3 in this manual.

Finally it is worth mentioning <CTRL> and <N>.  This command, within reading 
mode, causes Hal Lite to tell you its version and serial number.
 
Another method of examining the contents of the screen in reading mode is to 
use the cursor keys.  They have the following effect:
 
<cursor up>
takes the cursor up one line and reads that line

<cursor down>   
takes the cursor down one line and reads that line

<cursor right>
takes the cursor right one character and reads it

<cursor left>
takes the cursor left one character and reads it

<CTRL> and <cursor left>
takes the cursor left one word and reads it

<CTRL> and <cursor right>
takes the cursor right one word and reads it

<HOME>
takes the cursor to the start of the current line

<END>   
takes the cursor to the end of the current line

<PgUp>
takes the cursor to the start of the top line

<PgDn>
takes the cursor to the start of the bottom line

2.2 Introducing colours
 
So far we have been reading text on the screen regardless of its colour.  If 
you have one of the many forms of colour card in your computer, Hal Lite will 
allow you to find out the colour of certain text so that you can manipulate 
it for your own requirements.  Perhaps it should be mentioned at this point 
that it is not necessary for you to have a colour monitor at all - it is the 
colour card within the computer that Hal Lite is concerned with.

To find the colour of screen text, enter reading mode and place the cursor on 
a letter in the word.  Now press the letter <A> key.  The computer will speak 
the attributes of the character - there are three in all.  The first is the 
ASCII value which we will deal with much later on, the second is the 
background colour, and the third is the foreground colour.  An example might 
be "ASCII 65, background black, foreground white".  This means that it is a 
white upper case "A" on a black background. 

Now if you had a word processor which checked a document's spelling and 
changed all questionable words from white to red then you could use this 
facility to find out which words were questioned.

The first thing to do is to determine the colours involved by using the letter 
<A> key as described above.  You can try this if you wish on the "lesson" 
screen because it consists of a number of colours - make a note of the 
various background and foreground colours you come across.  (In fact there is 
an easier way of determining colour layout by permanently setting the 
attributes parameter option via the parameter menu.  This will be covered 
in later).

Now that you have ascertained the foreground and background colours involved 
we can proceed.  For example, if you want to restrict your output to red text 
on a black background enter <ALT> and <R>, the computer says "restrict to 
foreground?" followed by a colour.  If this colour is not red then tap the 
<SPACE BAR> to change it.  Continue to tap the <SPACE BAR>, cycling through 
the colours, until red is reached.  Now press <ENTER>. Hal Lite will now ask 
you what background colour you require by posing the question "background?" 
followed by a colour.  As before, cycle through the colour options using the 
<SPACE BAR> until you reach the desired choice - in our case "black".  Select 
this by pressing <ENTER>.

Now, if we read the screen one line at a time, only text in red on a black 
background will be spoken.  For example, on the Lesson screen you will only 
hear one line which reads "this line is in red".  This is a great time saver 
in certain applications.

The output may be restricted in three other ways as follows:
 
U  -  underlined text
B   -  blinking or flashing text
I   -  text in inverse video

Just enter <ALT> and <R> as before and then follow this by typing one of the 
letters <U>, <B> or <I>.  The expression "inverse video" simply means text 
whose foreground colour is the normal background colour, and whose background 
colour is normally the foreground colour.  Some word processors do this to 
text when, for example, it is defined as a "block".  Try this with the <B> 
option and then examine the "lesson" screen a line at a time.  You will only 
be able to read the text which says "but a blinking white line looks far more 
impressive".

The majority of programs only use eight foreground colours and eight 
background colours, namely, black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, yellow 
and white. However, on occasions you may come across "bright" foreground 
text. If you cycle through in the usual way beyond the eight standard colours 
you will hear the bright colours announced.
 
Finally, you will need to know how to remove colour restrictions so that 
Hal Lite can read text of any colour once again.  Simply enter <ALT> and <R> 
and, in answer to the question "restrict to foreground?" press <ESC>.  
Hal Lite will say "ignored" and come up with the question "background?".  
Again press <ESC> and once more Hal Lite will say "ignored". 

Similarly make use of the <ESC> key to ignore either foreground or background 
colours.  For example, if you wish to read a specific foreground text colour 
on any background colour just press <ESC> when asked for the background colour.  
Use the same procedure in reverse if you wish to read text of any colour on a 
specific background colour.
 
Practise restricting colour output as this will pay dividends in saved time.

3.   -  Finding and Marking

This lesson teaches you how to find individual characters or `strings' on 
your screen and also how to reference parts of the screen using `markers'.

3.1 Finding a character
 
It can be very boring examining a whole screen full of information to try and 
find just one word or character. Hal Lite can help you in this search if you 
use its "find" facility.
 
Enter reading mode and go to the top of the screen.  Now let's search for 
punctuation marks.  Press the letter <F> key and the computer will say "find".  
Now if we were searching for full stops you could hit that key, try it - the 
computer says "period" and then "found".  If you now see where your cursor is 
on the screen you will find that one depression of the letter <C> will read 
the character "period".

Hal Lite starts its search from the "home" position and looks along each row 
in turn, but suppose that we wanted to find another full stop?  If we were 
to hit <F> and <.> again then Hal Lite would return to the home position and 
start the search again and "find" the same full stop as before!  To avoid 
this you can continue the search from your present position by using the 
<|> "bar" key. 

If you are not sure where the bar key is experiment whilst in live mode 
depressing various keys until you hear Hal Lite say the word "bar".  On many 
computers it is shifted <\>.  Press the <F> key and then press the <|> key - 
repeat this for further occurrences of the character until there are no more 
full stops on the screen.  If the character is not found then Hal Lite will 
tell you.
 
You may combine the search facility with colour restriction.  If you wish to 
find a character of a particular colour, restrict output as described in the 
previous lesson. All other characters will be ignored.  Do not forget to turn 
the colour restriction off afterwards!

3.2 String search
 
If you wish to search for more than one character you will need to implement 
Hal Lite's string search facility.  A string is simply the expression used 
for a series of characters. For example, the word camel is a string as is the 
telephone number 035263529.

Suppose, for example, we want to find the word "this", first enter reading 
mode and tap the letter <T> to go to the top of the screen and then tap the 
</> "slash" key. Hal Lite will echo the words "search for?".  Now type in the 
four letters "this" and press <ENTER>.  If the word is on the screen Hal Lite 
will move the cursor to the start of the word and say "found".  If it is not 
on the screen Hal Lite will echo "not found".  Hal Lite does not discriminate 
between upper or lower case letters.

To find a second occurrence of the word simply depress </> again and 
immediately tap <ENTER>.  Hal Lite will take the cursor to the next 
occurrence of the word.  This process may be repeated as many times as you 
wish.

3.3 Marking the screen
 
Very often an application program such as a database will always lay out 
information on the screen in the same way. We can take advantage of this 
when in reading mode by setting markers at appropriate places which we can go 
to immediately.  (However, there is an alternative method using Hal Lite's 
window facility which is described later).
		
Move to any point on the screen and check its position with the <X> and <Y> 
keys.  Now hit the letter <M> key, the computer will say "set marker", select 
any letter of the alphabet, say the letter A.  Now move away from that 
position and hit the <G> key.  The computer will say "go to?".  Now tap the 
<A> key and you will be taken to your original position immediately.  Check 
this using the <X> and <Y> keys.  You can set up to 26 markers, one for each 
letter of the alphabet.  In fact when you first start using Hal Lite all 26 
markers are preset, A being the top line, B the second line etc.

Another facility offered by Hal Lite is that you can command it to move up 
and down a number of rows from your current position on the screen.  Try it 
using the <G> key. If you press number keys followed by any other key your 
position will immediately change to that row number.

Try pressing <G> then <1><9> and then the <SPACE BAR>.  You are now in row 
19, check this with the <Y> key.

Now if you wish to go back seven lines to row 12 simply enter <G> then the 
minus sign <-> and the number <7>. Tap the <SPACE BAR> and check your 
position with the <Y> key.  If you want to go back to row 19 then hit <G> 
and then the plus sign <+> followed by the number <7> and tap the <SPACE BAR>.  
Try this with other numbers.

A similar feature is available for moving along a row. To tell Hal Lite that 
you wish to move in that direction the comma is used after hitting the <G> 
key.  For example, press the <G> key, then the <,> key, then a number and 
press the <SPACE BAR>.  Check your position using the <X> key.  Say that you 
moved to column 15 and you wished to go to column 30, simply press <G> then 
hit the <,> key and then enter the plus sign followed by the number 15 and 
press the <SPACE BAR>.  Your position will immediately change to 30 - check 
this with the <X> key.

Although you may not feel there is much of a need for markers, you will find 
that later on when we come to consider monitor markers time invested in a 
thorough grounding in this subject will pay dividends.

4.   -  Live Mode

So far you have spent most of your time learning some of the special key 
commands within reading mode.  This lesson brings you out of reading mode to 
the normal or live mode where the keys do what you expect them to do.  
However, some of the reading commands that you have learnt can still be 
accessed by use of the <ALT> key.

4.1 Alt commands which work in live mode

<ALT> and <R>
to restrict colour output

<ALT> and <I>
to read a character and its phonetic representation

<ALT> and <O>
to read a word and its spelling

<ALT> and <G>
to read out your row and column number

<ALT> and <J>
to enter reading mode

<ALT> and <L>
to read your current line

<ALT> and <K>
to read your current line to the cursor

<ALT> and <T>
to read current time

<ALT> and <D>
to read current date

<ALT> and <M>
to mute the speech

You should find the <ALT> and <L> and <ALT> and <K> commands particularly 
useful when using a word processor.

4.2 Turning speech off and reading a window
 
The list below gives you two new commands to try

<ALT> and <V>   toggles speech output on and off
<ALT> and <P>   reads a window
 
Now for a few words of explanation:-

The word "toggle".  This simply means that the same action turns a facility 
both on and off, e.g. pressing a key once enables an activity, pressing the 
same key a second time disables the activity.
 
The <ALT> and <V> toggles between speech on and speech off.  This is useful 
if, say, a sighted person wants to use the computer for a few minutes. 

They might be aggravated by the sound of the speech - so simply enter <ALT> 
and <V> and when they have finished and you want the speech output back again 
enter <ALT> and <V> again.

You should never turn the synthesiser off while Hal Lite is running because 
the screen display is slowed down to a very great extent.
 
Finally a new command - <ALT> and <P>.  When you enter this command the 
computer asks "read?".  You then have to enter a window number.  Please 
don't worry about this new term "window".  It will be covered later.  All 
you have to know is that window number 0 is the whole screen.  So if you want 
to know the contents of the screen whilst in live mode simply enter <ALT> and 
<P> followed by the number <0>.  Remember that you can "shut up" the output 
temporarily with <ALT> and <M>.

Of course if you want to know what yellow text there is on the screen from 
live mode restrict output to yellow using <ALT> and <R> as previously 
explained, then <ALT> and <P> followed by the number <0>.  Hal Lite will now 
read all the yellow text on the screen.

4.3 The numeric keypad

When in live mode Hal Lite can make special use of the cursor keys.  Ensure 
that the number lock key is off and use the following cursor controls in 
conjunction with the left shift key depressed.

The numbers <1>, <2> and <3> read the previous, current and next character.  
The numbers <4>, <5> and <6> read the previous, current and next word.  The 
numbers <7>, <8> and <9> read the previous, current and next line.  The 
number <0> is mute.
 
A final command is the use of left shift key with the numeric key pad "point" 
<.> key.  This action causes Hal Lite to read the current sentence - that is, 
the text between the previous full stop and the next.
 
These special features are particularly useful when editing a document in a 
word processor.  Don't forget the sentence reading facility that Hal Lite 
offers in reading mode using the "shifted point" command.  This enables you 
to read a whole screen of text a sentence at a time whenever "shifted point" 
is depressed. 

In live mode the numbers on the keyboard can be accessed normally simply by 
putting the number lock on or using the right hand shift key.

5.   -  Adjustments to Hal Lite

This lesson tells you how to adjust your speech synthesiser from Hal Lite 
and introduces you to HAL's parameter menu.

5.1 Adjusting the speech
 
There are two methods of adjusting your speech synthesiser.  The first is to 
adjust the "box" itself - for example turning the volume control up and down.  
The other way is to ask Hal Lite to send commands to the "box". Hal Lite can 
do this to the three Series 2 Synthesisers made by Dolphin.  The three 
synthesisers are called the Apollo 2, PC2 card and the Juno-sp.  If you have 
another speech synthesiser then you won't be able to control it from Hal Lite.

To adjust the speed of the speech on your Dolphin Series 2 Synthesiser use 
<ALT> and <S> in either reading or live mode to cycle through the speed 
options.  Another way is to use the function keys <F1> and <F2> in reading 
mode. 

Additional refinements to the speech are controlled by the other function 
keys within reading mode.  To change variables such as pitch (use <F3> and 
<F4>), prosody or excitability (use <F5> and <F6>), inter word pause (use <F7> 
and <F8>), and inter phrase pause (use <F9> and <F10>).

Please note that it is not possible to change the speed of the speech whilst 
your speech synthesiser is talking.  Any alterations made whilst it is 
talking will not be effective until it has finished.
 
A good way to check your ideal speed is to use <ALT> and <P> followed by the 
number <0> to read the whole screen. Please note that many users find that 
using headphones allows them to understand speech at faster speeds.

<ALT> and <Q> toggles hypermode on and off.  The hypermode allows you to skim 
read by only reading the important words.  For example "The rain in Spain 
falls mainly on the plain" sounds like "rain Spain falls mainly plain".

The <ALT> and <Q> command works in either screen reading or live mode.  
Please note that when in hypermode the two alphabetic characters A and I do 
not give keyboard echo.  This is because Hal Lite thinks of them as single 
letter words and as a consequence ignores them. 

However, they will have been entered into the text and this can be checked 
by turning hypermode off.

You also have the ability to alter the volume of your synthesiser directly 
from Hal Lite.  (<ALT> and <Z> decreases the volume and <ALT> and <X> 
increases the volume.)

The Juno synthesiser is designed to be fully controllable from the keyboard 
and so it does not have a volume control on it.

Furthermore, <ALT> and <B> will restore the speech characteristics (volume, 
rate, pitch and prosody) to their default settings.

We have implemented this feature as the Juno synthesiser automatically 
switches off to conserve battery power if you remove Hal Lite from memory 
HLITE -r.

5.2 The parameter menu
 
Hal Lite is an extremely flexible program and allows many changes to be made 
to the way that it operates.  These changes are referred to as parameter 
adjustments and are carried out by using the parameter menu.  This menu is 
simply a list of items which can be changed easily to suit your own needs.

In this section we take an initial look at the parameter menu.  To enter the 
parameter menu, press the letter <P> key when within reading mode.  To leave 
the menu at any time simply hit the <ESC> key - this returns you to reading 
mode.

5.2.1 Getting a feel for the parameters
 
Enter reading mode with <ALT> and <J> and tap the letter <P> to enter the 
parameter menu.  Hal Lite will say "parameter menu" followed by the first 
parameter which is keyboard echo followed by its current option.  The default 
option is to echo every character depressed on the keyboard.  You will 
therefore hear the information spoken thus - "parameter menu - key echo - 
characters".
 
Let us now move on to examine the current option of the other parameters.  
This is achieved by using the <TAB> key - each time you depress the <TAB> key 
Hal Lite speaks the parameter followed by its current option.  Do not worry if 
these do not make sense to you - hopefully many of them will by the end of 
this manual!

If you depress the <TAB> key once, Hal Lite will say "screen - auto".  Press 
<TAB> again and "screen punctuation - all" will be heard.  Continue in this 
way "tabbing" through the menu.  Eventually you will return to your original 
"key echo - characters".

You may also use the up and down cursor keys to move through the parameter 
menu.
 
Now that we have familiarised ourselves with the parameters within the menu 
we can press <ESC> to exit from it and return to reading mode.  Hal Lite will 
inform you by saying "exit parameter menu".

5.2.2 Changing the parameter options
 
In this section we will learn how to select the various options available for 
each parameter.  The process is simple - first select the parameter using the 
<TAB> key as outlined above.  Secondly, cycle through the available options 
for that parameter using the <SPACE BAR>.

Enter the parameter menu by going into reading mode and depressing the letter 
<P> key.  Now <TAB> through the menu until you reach the "caps - off" point.  
This means that when a capital or upper case letter is typed it sounds just 
like a lower case letter.  Now tap the <SPACE BAR> once.  Hal Lite says "caps - 
on" to indicate that upper case letters will be spoken with the prefix "caps".  
Exit the parameter menu with the <ESC> key and then return to live mode with 
<ENTER>.

Now try typing an upper case letter and see for yourself how Hal Lite 
differentiates between upper and lower case. Hal Lite will also tell you the 
case difference when screen reading.

To revert back to the original setting, simply re-enter the parameter menu, 
<TAB> through the parameters until "caps - on" is reached and depress the 
<SPACE BAR> once.  Hal Lite will say "caps - off".  Leave the parameter menu 
by using the <ESC> key and return to live mode by tapping <ENTER>.
 
In this section we have had an overview of the parameter menu.  We know how 
to enter it using the letter <P> from reading mode.  We have also tabbed 
through all the parameters and changed one parameter option by using the 
<SPACE BAR> to toggle between "caps - off" to "caps - on" and then back again.

Essentially this is all there is to using the parameter menu.  However in 
future lessons we will take a longer look at all the parameters and how to 
save any option changes

6. -  More Adjustments to Hal Lite

This lesson explains some more of the basic parameters and discusses the 
options for them.

6.1 Keyboard echo
 
Enter screen reading and use the letter <P> to move into the parameter menu.  
The first parameter to be spoken will be "key echo" which refers to the level 
of keyboard echo.  The default setting is for every character key to be 
spoken - hence the spoken message "key echo - characters".
 
Tap the <SPACE BAR> to change this to "key echo - words".  Hit <ESC> to exit 
the menu and <ENTER> to exit reading mode.  Now you will notice the 
difference when typing - instead of each individual character being echoed 
the whole word is spoken whenever the <SPACE BAR> or a punctuation mark is 
depressed.  Many users find this type of keyboard echo preferable to having 
every single character spoken.

Please note - when key echo is set to words, if you hear nothing spoken or 
you hear the previous character being spoken as you type then the muting 
parameter option is set to on.  Change this to off or cursors and your words 
setting will work.

Now return to the parameter menu and change key echo once again.  The third 
option is "key echo - off".  Some users prefer no feedback at all when they 
are typing, only using speech to check their work after input.  If you tap 
the <SPACE BAR> again you will return to the original setting of "key echo - 
characters".  You can cycle through the options in this way as many times as 
you wish.

6.2 Changing more than one parameter
 
So far we have only made one change at a time to the parameter options - 
changing the speaking of caps in the previous lesson and changing the 
keyboard echo earlier in this lesson.

Suppose that we want to change two or more parameters? Start by entering the 
parameter menu and changing the keyboard echo option using the <SPACE BAR>.  
When the desired option is reached simply press the <TAB> key - the keyboard 
echo will remain at your selected setting and you will move on to the next 
parameter.

Hal Lite will now say "screen - auto". Try changing this by using the <SPACE 
BAR> to take it through all the options thus auto, off and on.  As we have 
landed on this parameter we had better explain its function!

Under almost every circumstance Hal Lite works out for itself the best way to 
speak screen text - this is the auto option.  Just occasionally there is a 
problem with Hal Lite speaking everything twice or saying too much; if this 
happens try the "screen - off" option.  Similarly the "screen - on" option 
can be of value on rare occasions.
 
As mentioned above, the "screen - auto" option is usually the best, so cycle 
through these options again until you return to "auto".  Now we could either 
press the <TAB> key to move on to the next parameter or hit the <ESC> key to 
leave the menu.  Use <ESC> and then <ENTER> to return to live mode.

Thus you can see that it is possible to change as many parameter options as 
you wish without having to continually enter and exit the menu. 

6.3 Nine more parameters

So far we have learnt three things about the parameter menu:
 
* how to enter and exit the parameter menu
* how to move from parameter to parameter using the <TAB> or cursor keys
* how to cycle through each parameter's options using the <SPACE BAR>

From this point on we will not continually repeat these basic instructions 
but rather concentrate on describing some more parameters and their options.

6.3.1 Screen punctuation
 
This refers to punctuation spoken during screen reading. There are four 
levels - off, some, most and all - e.g. the most option pronounces all 
punctuation apart from the apostrophe.  Try experimenting with the various 
settings to see which you prefer.


6.3.2 Key echo punctuation
 
This parameter refers to the level of punctuation echoed by keyboard entry.  
It has identical options to the screen punctuation mentioned above.  Try the 
four options for yourself.  However, most users prefer the default value of 
all keyboard punctuation spoken.

6.3.3 Space and return
 
This parameter refers to the keyboard echo of the <SPACE BAR> and <ENTER> key.  
The options are either on or off.  If you only require one of these keys to 
speak please see the section on teaching keys later in this lesson.

6.3.4 Blank lines
 
This parameter toggles between blank lines being announced or not.  Sometimes 
it is useful when editing or screen reading to be reminded when a line 
contains no text, in which case blank - on should be selected.

6.3.5 Compress punctuation
 
This parameter allows you to choose how Hal Lite speaks punctuation marks 
displayed on the screen.  This facility is offered because many application 
programs use rows of dashes or stars for decorative purposes - if Hal Lite 
were to read them all it could be a very tedious process.  The options are 
on or off - for example if you set compress punctuation to on Hal Lite will 
only read the first two punctuation marks even if there is a whole row of 
them.

6.3.6 Announce Alt and Control keys
 
This parameter allows you the option of Hal Lite speaking these two keys when 
they are depressed.  It is particularly useful for beginners who are 
unaccustomed to the PC keyboard but more advanced users will probably prefer 
to set this option to off.  There is a third option muting, which causes the 
synthesiser to be muted when <ALT> and <CTRL> are pressed together.

6.3.7 Speaking numbers

This parameter has two options - NUMBERS on or NUMBERS off.  This controls 
whether a numbers' individual digits are read out, or the number is read out 
as a whole, e.g. 123 can be read out as "one two three", or "one hundred and 
twenty three".

The file NUMBERS.??? is a text file and defines how numbers are spoken.  The 
extension ??? is taken from the prompt file name.  Thus PROMPT.ITA will bring 
in NUMBERS.ITA.  See Appendix 3 for details of the numbers prompt file.  The 
number option must be on and the numbers file must exist for numbers to be 
spoken.

6.3.8 Leading Zeroes

This parameter is directly after NUMBERS  on/off in the parameter menu.

'ZERO on' means that, if NUMBERS are set to on, leading zeros will be spoken.  
(Especially useful for telephone numbers).  E.g.

0905 will be spoken as "zero nine hundred and five".

The default setting is off.

6.3.9 Exceptions

This parameter has two options - words on or words off. This controls what 
Hal Lite says when it comes across certain user defined strings on the screen.  
These strings are defined in an Exceptions Dictionary.  The file ENGLISH.DIC 
is the default name for the Exceptions Dictionary file.  Supplied on the HAL 
LITE disk is a program called DEDIT to create/alter an Exceptions Dictionary. 
Details of how to use DEDIT and how to load Exceptions Dictionaries are given 
later.

6.4 Teaching Hal Lite to Speak
 
You can teach Hal Lite to speak in two ways - firstly according to the key 
depressed and secondly according to the character being read from the screen.

6.4.1 Teaching keys
 
Within reading mode <CTRL> and <T> prompts Hal Lite to ask "teach which key?"  
In response to this tap a key, say function key number 10, Hal Lite will then 
respond "enter string".  Now type in the words you want Hal Lite to speak when 
function key 10 is depressed.  Hit <ENTER> and Hal Lite will inform you "done".  
If you exit reading mode and try tapping function key 10 it will now repeat 
your chosen words.  This facility can be a most useful reminder of key 
definitions within application software.
 
Please note - if key echo is set to words then some keys will not speak the 
string that they have been taught.

6.4.2 Teaching screen characters
 
The <CTRL> and <S> command within reading mode allows you to teach Hal Lite 
what to say when it comes across a particular character on the screen.  
Suppose you wish Hal Lite to speak the words "divided by" every time it comes 
across the "slash" sign on the screen.  Try entering <CTRL> and <S>.  Hal Lite 
responds with the question "teach which character?" Enter "slash".  Hal Lite 
will say "enter string".  Now type in the two words "divided by" and hit 
<ENTER>.  Hal Lite will inform you done.  From now on every time Hal Lite 
comes across the slash character it will say "divided by".

It is possible to teach Hal Lite to speak characters which are not normally 
spoken, for example a high ASCII character such as ASCII 190, "ù".  Simply 
enter <CTRL> and <S> as before and when prompted "teach which character?" 
depress the <ALT> key and enter the number 190 on the numeric keypad whilst 
the <ALT> key remains depressed.  Now release the <ALT> key and Hal Lite will 
prompt you to enter the string.  Type in your message, e.g. "marker" and 
<ENTER>.  Hal Lite will inform you "done".

7. -  Parameters

This section completes the description of Hal Lite's basic command set and 
describes some special features not mentioned in the earlier lessons.  Most 
users may never need to know about these features.

7.1 Command line entries
 
All additional command line entries beyond the Hal Lite program name are 
separated by a space and the dash sign -.  It is important to note that this 
is not the underline character.

HLITE  -r
removes Hal Lite from the system

HLITE  -ffilename
loads the environment filename in to Hal Lite

HLITE  -dpath
for files which have no path, e.g. hal.spc, prompt.hal and english.dic, this 
is the absolute "path" to be used
 
HLITE  -d
sets absolute path to the current directory

HLITE  -pfilename
loads the prompt file filename

HLITE -a
loads the default Exceptions Dictionary, english.dic

HLITE  -afilename
loads the Exceptions Dictionary "filename"

HLITE  -n
bypass test for valid directory. (Needed for networks)

HLITE  -m##
where ## is the size in kilobytes of the largest Exceptions Dictionary needed

HLITE -c
Send speech output to PC 2 card (default address)

HLITE -c2
Send speech output to PC 2 card (secondary address)

HLITE -1
Send speech output to Apollo 2/Juno on COM1.

HLITE -2
Send speech output to Apollo 2/Juno on COM2.

HLITE -3
Send speech output to Apollo 2/Juno on COM3.

HLITE -4
Send speech output to Apollo 2/Juno on COM4.

HLITE -KG
Disables monitor markers from firing in 'graphics mode'.

Some HAL users experience a scrambled screen when using the 'graphics mode' 
page preview facility of WordPerfect.  If you experience this problem, then 
use the -KG command line option.

The following options can be used on the command line of a currently running 
Hal Lite.

HLITE  -dpath
HLITE  -ffilename
HLITE  -pfilename
(see above for details

8. - Advanced parameters

After reading the Hal Lite User Guide and this lesson, you will have covered 
all the basic parameters and their options.  There will still be a number of 
advanced parameters that have not been covered and these will be dealt with 
later on in the manual.
 
8.1 Muting
 
One of the problems associated with using speech to access text is how to 
stop the synthesiser talking unnecessarily.  We have already considered the 
<ALT> and <M> and <SHIFT> and <0> methods for muting. However, Hal Lite 
offers three more refined options within the muting parameter which should 
cover most contingencies.

When muting is set to on the depression of any key instantly mutes anything 
that is being spoken.  So, for example, if you were typing with every 
character being echoed by Hal Lite then you could never "out-type" the speech 
because any outstanding speech would be muted by your typing - this is why the 
key echo parameter will not work on words when muting is on.  As Hal Lite is 
triggered to read a word when the <SPACE BAR> is pressed so the word is muted! 

The outcome of all this is silence (although some software packages give a 
strange effect of making Hal Lite speak the previously typed character).

Another option is muting - all commands which is identical to muting - on but 
functions only within reading mode.
 
The third option is muting - cursors.  This option is identical to muting - 
on but only applies to the cursor keys.  It is particularly useful when 
reading through documents in a word processor because you do not have to wait 
until a whole line is spoken before going on to the next line - simply hit 
the appropriate cursor key to stop the current line being spoken and start 
hearing the next line.  This setting is favoured by users who set the key echo 
parameter to words.

The final option is muting - off which turns off Hal Lite's special muting 
facilities mentioned above.  However the <ALT> and <M> command is still 
available.

8.2 Sound parameters
 
Hal Lite can produce a number of musical notes to present you with 
information such as the cursor position, typing of upper case letters and 
Hal Lite error messages.  There are three options - all, off and an 
intermediate one called beeps.
 
Having sounds - all on greatly helps when screen reading.  For example, when 
reading lines the pitch of the musical note decreases as you move further 
down the screen.  When reading a word at a time the musical pitch increases 
as you progress along the line.

The musical notes can also help when reading characters as it is possible to 
differentiate between upper and lower case letters, punctuation, spaces and 
control characters. Do not be concerned about the term "control characters" 
as they will be discussed in more detail later.  (However, if you come across 
an invisible character on the screen which emits a high pitched note then it 
is a control character!)  Musical notes are also useful in live mode because 
a tone is emitted when upper case letters are typed.

The second option is sounds - beeps.  This option gives limited musical beep 
feedback including beeps when typing capital letter keys.  Finally sounds - 
off simply turns off all musical sound output from Hal Lite.
 
The best approach to this parameter is to try all three options and use the 
one which meets your needs.  If your computer has a volume control be sure 
to turn it up before embarking on any experiments.

8.3 Attributes

As we saw earlier, every character on the screen (including spaces) has three 
attributes to describe it.  Just to remind ourselves, these three are:
 
* foreground colour
* background colour
* ASCII value

The ASCII value is a special number which is given to every character - for 
example an upper case A has an ASCII value of 65.  (By the way ASCII stands 
for American Standard Code for Information Interchange).  These ASCII values 
need not concern us at this stage. Earlier we discovered how to ascertain the 
attributes of individual characters, now we move on to a more sophisticated 
way which gives the information a line at a time by using the parameter menu.
 
Enter reading mode and then enter the parameter menu. <TAB> through to the 
attributes parameter and use the <SPACE BAR> to select the option attributes - 
on.  Use the <ESC> key to return to reading mode and try reading the screen a 
line at a time - as well as hearing the usual text on the screen you will 
also be told the background and foreground colours.  

Additionally, you can be given this information on your current line when in 
live mode by pressing <ALT> and <L>.

As we have seen this data can be very useful during the planning stage of 
colour restriction and will be even more useful later on when we consider 
highlighted text.

8.4 Compressing spaces
 
When Hal Lite reads two words separated by a number of spaces there may be a 
slight time delay.  This can be either a useful clue to screen layout or an 
annoying feature.  Hal Lite allows you to set the delay to compress - on/off 
or 1-20.

When this parameter is set in the range 1 to 20 it controls the length of the 
pause in the speech when Hal Lite comes across multiple spaces on the screen.  
(1 being the shortest pause and 20 being the longest pause.)

As with many of Hal Lite's advanced features it is often a question of 
personal taste as to the setting of a particular parameter option.  The best 
policy is to experiment until you find the appropriate combination for your 
needs.

8.5 Cursor, Enter and Tab actions
 
Within Hal Lite these three types of key have certain elements in common.  
However, the cursor keys are particularly flexible so we will deal with them 
first.

8.6 The cursor keys
 
The cursor keys are often used in application programs such as word 
processors, databases and spreadsheets to allow you to move around the screen 
rather as in reading mode with the up, down, left and right commands.  As you 
have seen, the cursor keys can be used in reading mode to do just that.  
However, when you are not running an application program and the computer is 
at DOS level the cursor keys are not used in this way.
 
You may be interested to know that at DOS level the left and right cursor 
keys have a special effect.  Try entering: lessons  <ENTER> with the Hal Lite 
disk in Drive A. You will get an error message because there is no such file 
on the disk.  Now at the A:> prompt hit the right arrow key a couple of times 
and check your current line with <ALT> and <L>.  You will find that beyond 
the prompt are the first couple of letters of the word "lessons". 

Continue to tap the right arrow key until "lesson" appears, then hit the 
<ENTER> key and the program will load.  If you go too far and get the whole 
word "lessons" on the screen, just tap the left arrow key and it will delete 
the letter "s" from the end.  Your MS-DOS manual will give you many more 
useful hints and tips of this kind.

8.7 Cursor, carriage return and tab keys - common options
 
Having dealt specifically with cursor key actions we can now move on to 
consider a number of common options applicable to cursor, carriage return and 
tab keys.
 
The parameters cursor does, return does and tab does each have nineteen 
options and they are listed and explained below:

lines
reads the line that the cursor is on.

highlighted text
this will be dealt in Lesson 4.

to cursor
reads text on line up to cursor position.

column
reads column number of cursor position.

read two lines  
reads the line above the current line and the current line.

read three lines
reads two lines above, one line above and the current line.

read window 0 
through 9
windows will be dealt with later in the manual.

off
no spoken output.

characters
speaks the character at the cursor.

words           
speaks the word at the cursor.

Although at first sight some of these options might appear obscure, experience 
has found them to be very useful in a number of applications as we will see 
later.  However, in the meantime, the default option settings of cursor does 
lines, return does off and tab does off are probably the most sensible.

8.8 Timer wait and extra key checks
 
These two parameters relate to the interaction between Hal Lite, an 
application program and the depression of cursor keys.  The technicalities of 
this interaction need not concern us here but suffice it to say that should 
any problems be experienced when using the cursor keys in a program, changing 
these parameter options can help.  An example of such a problem is an 
excessively long delay elapsing between pressing a cursor key and Hal Lite's 
spoken response.

8.9 Document Read

This advanced facility allows you to read a whole document from within your 
favourite word processor, and edit it easily.  This will be very application 
dependent, so Document Read will need to be set up for each application you 
use.

Hal Lite allows you to stop the Document Read at any time by pressing <SPACE>.  
Hal Lite will then automatically move the application's cursor to the word or 
sentence that was being read.

Document Read needs to be configured for each individual application Hal Lite 
uses.  Therefore setting the correct parameters in Hal Lite's parameter menu 
is very important.

To configure Document Read you need to enter Hal Lite's parameter menu.  (You 
will find the options at the bottom of the menu).

Do this by pressing:

<ALT> and <J>, then <P>  

Hal Lite will respond by saying "parameter menu".

Use the <TAB> key to move to the options that start with the "Document Read" 
message.  (You can cycle through the options for each Document Read parameter 
using <SPACE>). Here is a list of the Document Read parameters (and what they 
do):

Document Read mode

Options:        Off 
		On 
		All 
		All Extra Key Checks

This parameter controls the mode in which Document Read operates.

Off             Turns Document Read off
On              Turns Document Read on
All             Changes the way Document Read interacts with an application.  
		You should use this option  if spoken words or lines are 
		incomplete.
All Extra
Key Checks      Changes the way Document Read interacts with an application.  
You should use this option if none of the above options work.

Document Read does
	
Options:        off 
characters 
words
lines 
highlighted text 
to cursor 
column 
read two lines 
read three lines 
read window 0 through 9

This parameter works in the same way as the Cursor does parameter in the 
parameter menu, and controls whether Document Read moves a whole words, a 
whole line, etc. at a time whilst moving through the document.

Document Read  -  Document Read Window
	
Options:        window 1 to 9 
		off

Each application you use has its own way of signalling it is at the end of a 
document (End of document code).  So Hal Lite has a user-definable way of 
checking for the end of a document.

You must define a single line window around the area of the screen in which 
the application displays its line, row and column information.  You should 
try to make the single line window as small as possible so Hal Lite can check 
the end of document status quickly.  
		
For example in WordPerfect the status line looks something like:

Doc 1 Pg 1 Ln 1 Pos 1

You would create the single line window around the Doc 1 Pg 1 Ln 1 Pos 1 area.  
Once the end of a document is reached in WordPerfect, the line number will no 
longer change.  Hal Lite will then know that the end of a document has been 
reached.  

N.B.  Window 0 cannot be defined as the Document Read Window.

This option should be used in conjunction with Document Read  -  
For same / For change parameter, detailed below.

Document Read - For Same / For Change

Options:        for same 
		for change

This option works in a similar way to monitor markers.  If the Document Read 
Window remains the same when the end of a document is reached then the for 
same option should be selected.  e.g. in WordPerfect the line number does not 
change when the end of a document has been reached. If the application 
displays a message line or pop-up box to signify the end of a document, use 
the for change option.

This option is application-dependent.  

Document Read  -  Blank

Options:        2 to 99 
		off

This is another method of monitoring for the end of a document.  This option 
tells Hal Lite to monitor for blank lines/words rather than monitoring the 
Document Read Window.  You can specify the number of lines/words for Hal Lite 
to look for, from 2 through 99.  This will be useful where applications do not 
have a status line or you want to stop reading after a fixed number of lines.

Document Read Delay
	
Options:        on 
		off

If an application seems to be reading the wrong information from the screen, 
e.g. Hal Lite is reading the previous line all the time, then switch this 
parameter on.  Otherwise leave it off.

Document Read Forward

This parameter defines the keystroke which your application uses to move the 
cursor forward within a document, by default it is <CTRL> and <cursor right>.  
For example, VIEW (see "ASCII file viewer") uses the <cursor right> to move 
the cursor forward through the document.  So, to define this keystroke you 
would:

*       Move to the Document Read Forward parameter in the parameter menu.

*       Next, press <ENTER>.

*       Now, press the down arrow key.

Hal Lite will then say "done".  The Document Read Forward keystroke has now 
been set.

Document Read Backward

This parameter defines the keystroke which your application uses to move the 
cursor backward within a document, by default it is <CTRL> and <left cursor>.

For example, VIEW (see "ASCII file viewer") uses the <up cursor> to move the 
cursor backward through the document.  So, to define this keystroke you would:

*       Move to the Document Read Backward parameter in the parameter menu.

*       Next, press <ENTER>.

*       Now, press the down arrow key.

Hal Lite will then say "done".  The Document Read Backward keystroke has now 
been set.

N.B.  When using Document Read you must make sure that a forward keystroke 
followed by a backward keystroke leaves your cursor position unchanged.

Document Read  -  Timer Wait

Options:        0 to 99

This parameter works in exactly the same way as Timer Wait parameter.

It is useful to note that when using Document Read  -  Timer 
Wait you should start by setting it to the same as the Timer Wait parameter.

If you place a high number in this option your application may jam.

Starting Document Read

To activate the Document Read facility you need to press:

<ALT> and <P>, then <C>  

in live mode.

The synthesiser will then start to read the document, until the end of the 
document is reached, or a key is pressed.

* When Hal Lite has been set up correctly to use the Document Read facility, 
it should return the message "End of Document" when it reaches the last line 
in a document.

8.10 Cursors Wait

If Cursors Wait is set to off then Hal Lite will delay the application from 
getting the next keypress.

9.   -  Simple Windows

You have already come across the <ALT> and <P> command to read window number 
zero - the whole screen.  This lesson teaches you how to define up to nine 
other windows of any size and position.

9.1 Defining the window

Windows can be very useful to give you instant access to useful parts of the 
screen such as status lines.  A window can be as small as part of a line, or 
a whole line or a block of lines.  Also, windows can overlap each other.  
Just imagine drawing a rectangle on the screen which covers text that you are 
interested in - that is a window and you can read it immediately using the 
<ALT> and <P> command.

Firstly, enter reading mode and explore the screen to decide upon the area 
you wish to define as a window. Now position the cursor at the point you 
wish to become the top left hand corner of the window.  Hit the <W> key and 
Hal Lite will say "window".  Tap the letter <S> for start of window and a 
number, say <1>.  We have now defined the top left hand corner of window 
1.  Next move the cursor to the point which is to be the bottom right hand 
corner of the window.  Hit <W> for window then the letter <E> for end of 
window and finally a number, - the number <1> in this example.

Having defined window number 1 we can try reading it. Exit from reading mode 
to live mode and enter <ALT> and <P> followed by the number <1>.  Hal Lite 
will read all the text within the window.  As mentioned before, this is 
particularly useful for reading status lines such as those found in word 
processors and spreadsheets.  Remember, you can define up to nine windows 
using the numbers 1 through 9.  Window number 0 is always the entire screen 
and cannot be changed.
 
Of course you can use the <ALT> and <R> command to restrict the output of 
the window to a colour combination, underlined, blinking or inverse video 
text.

9.2 Entering the window
 
In reading mode you can go into a window by tapping the <W> key for window 
followed by the window number - number <1> in our example.  As soon as you 
have done this Hal Lite thinks of the window as being the whole screen and 
will not allow you out of the area defined as that window number.  You can 
read it using all the standard commands such as <T>, <L> etc.  This can be 
very useful for taking you straight to the area of the screen that interests 
you - for example one field in a database.
 
By using <ALT> and <R> you can limit output from the window even further by 
restricting colour output.  So, for example, if you were only interested in 
red text on a black background within your window you could access this 
information very quickly.

You can come out of the window in a number of ways. Firstly simply by exiting 
reading mode with the <ENTER> key or by tapping <W> for window and hitting 
the number <0>: this makes the whole screen your window again.  Another method 
is to go to a marker outside of the window.

10.   -  Find and Output Windows

You have now learnt the basic concepts associated with windows.  This lesson 
goes on to examine two specific types of window.

10.1 The find window
 
We have already come across the find command in reading mode and the use of 
the <|> character to find further occurrences in the search.  With a find 
window we limit the extent of the search to the text within the window.
 
First of all define a window, then within reading mode enter the parameter 
menu and cycle through the parameters with the <TAB> key.  When you reach 
find window - 0 cycle through the window numbers using the <SPACE BAR> until 
you reach your defined window number.  Then exit the parameter menu.  From 
now on your find facility will only work within that window number. 

Again you can narrow down the search still further by restricting the colour 
of the character being searched for by using <ALT> and <R> in the usual way.
 
Hal Lite's string search facility can be limited in exactly the same way to a 
find window with or without colour restriction.

Experiment with find windows using both single character and string searches 
to acquaint yourself completely with the concept of windows before continuing 
with the next section.

10.2 The output window
 
So far we have only been considering windows within reading mode (apart from 
the <ALT> and <P> command in live mode).  The concept of the output window is 
different because it determines what part of the screen is output in live 
mode.
 
In many application programs which are menu driven the entire menu is spoken 
just as it appears on the screen. However you might not wish this to happen 
because, for example, the menu contains a digital clock which is always being 
updated and hence all you hear is the time being repeated over and over again. 

If you define an output window which excludes the clock display then only the 
part of the screen within the window area is spoken and the clock is silenced.
 
To define an output window, start off in the usual way by defining a window 
which excludes areas of the screen which you do not wish to be output.

Next, we have to tell Hal Lite that this window number is an output window.  
Do this by cycling through the parameters until you reach output window. Now 
tap the <SPACE BAR> until you hear your window number spoken.  Escape from 
the parameter menu and exit reading mode.  Future screen output will only 
come from within the area of your output window.  Reading of text with <ALT> 
and <L>, <ALT> and <K>, cursor keys etc. are also restricted to the output 
window in live mode.
 
The simple window described in Lesson 2 together with the find and output 
windows covered in this lesson really are more straightforward than might be 
imagined at first reading.  As with every concept outlined in this manual the 
secret of understanding lies in practical experimentation and this will pay 
dividends when we move on.

11.   -  Highlighted Text

This lesson  moves on to discuss highlighted text.  This is text that you 
consider important or of high profile.  You may choose to define your 
highlighted text  as being of any colour, blinking, underlined, or inverse 
video text.  It does not have to be a bright colour or even the colour that 
the application program you are running refers to as `highlighted'.

11.1 Setting the highlight option
 
Suppose we decide that information given in the colour green on a black 
background is of great importance within a particular application program.  
If we define this colour combination as being our highlight colour then 
Hal Lite offers us a number of ways to quickly access this data.
 
First of all, we need to tell Hal Lite that green foreground with a black 
background is our choice as highlighted text.  To do this use the parameter 
menu and <TAB> through until "highlight is" is spoken.  Tap the <SPACE BAR> 
and Hal Lite will say "highlighted text - foreground - black".  

Use the <SPACE BAR> to cycle through the foreground colour options until the 
desired colour is reached - green in our example.  

If your foreground colour is to be a "bright" colour then continue with the 
<SPACE BAR> until your desired colour is reached.  Now tap the <ENTER> key 
and Hal Lite will offer you the background colour options.  Cycle through 
these until the desired colour is reached and then hit the <ENTER> key.  
Hal Lite will confirm your choice of background and foreground colours which 
make up your definition of highlighted text.
 
When using the method described above to select the highlight colour of your 
choice you may wish to choose a particular foreground colour regardless of 
its background colour or you may wish to choose text of any colour on a 
specific background colour.  You can do this by telling Hal Lite to ignore 
either the foreground or background option by pressing the <ESC> key instead 
of selecting a colour.  Hal Lite will announce "ignored" in confirmation.
 
Finally, you may choose blinking, underlined or text in inverse video by 
entering either the letter <B>, <U> or <I> after tapping the <SPACE BAR> once 
(instead of cycling through the colour options with the <SPACE BAR>).  
Hal Lite will announce your choice in confirmation.

It is important to be clear that choosing a highlight colour is not the same 
as restricting output to a certain colour combination.  You could, for example, 
have selected green on black as the highlight colour but have output 
restricted to red on white.

Now the easiest way to read the highlighted text on the screen is by using 
<ALT> and <Y>.  Try it and see. Notice, as mentioned above, that you can read 
the highlighted text even when output is restricted to another colour.  
Pressing <ALT> and <Y> a second time will spell the highlighted text.  This 
is similar to <ALT> and <O>, when pressed once it reads the word that the 
cursor is on, when pressed a second time it spells the word the cursor is on.

Try experimenting at this early stage so that you are quite sure that you can 
differentiate between the concepts of restricting output and highlighting 
text.  It might help to think of output restriction (<ALT> and <R>) as being 
negative whereas highlighting output is a positive act.

11.2 The highlight window
 
It is possible to limit the amount of highlighted text which is read by <ALT> 
and <Y> to a specific area of the screen by using a new type of window - the 
highlight window.

The window is constructed in the usual way (see Lesson 2).  Say, for example, 
you make it window 6, Hal Lite now needs to be told that this is to be 
considered as a highlight window.  Simply move through the parameter menu 
until you reach highlight window.  Now cycle through the window numbers by 
means of the <SPACE BAR> until you reach highlight window - 6, escape from 
the menu and then exit to live mode.  The command <ALT> and <Y> will now only 
read highlighted text within the confines of window 6.

Again we stress the need to practice these techniques.  It is not enough to 
simply read these lessons.  The use of highlighted text and highlight windows 
is a very powerful tool which, if understood, will save you much time.

11.3 Accessing highlighted text with the Tab, Return and Cursor keys.
    
So far we have only used <ALT> and <Y> to access the highlighted text.  We 
now move on to see some very useful additions.
 
In some applications it might be desirable to have the highlighted text 
spoken when either the <TAB>, <ENTER> or cursor keys are hit.  All these 
keys can be defined to do this via the parameter menu.  Simply <TAB> through 
to either tab does, return does or cursor does. 

Now cycle through the options with the <SPACE BAR> until you reach highlighted 
text.  Return to live mode - you will find that each time the key is 
depressed all highlighted text is spoken.  If you have set a highlight window, 
only the highlighted text within that window will be spoken.
 
Please note that the <TAB> and <ENTER> keys are often defined in a special 
way by an application program which may override any definition which you 
may have given them.
 
The definition of cursor keys is particularly useful in application programs 
such as spreadsheets.

A spreadsheet is simply a grid of boxes on the screen rather like a chess 
board.  Each square is called a "cell" and the data entered into it is 
displayed in one colour on the screen.  As you move the cursor around the 
cells the colour of the cell which the cursor is on changes.  This is simply 
a device to show you where the cursor is.  When the cursor is on a cell it is 
called the active cell.  Now this colour change can be taken advantage of by 
Hal Lite.

If we know the foreground colour of the contents of the active cell then we 
can set that as the highlight colour. Now if we program the cursor keys to 
read highlighted text, as we cursor around the spreadsheet we shall have the 
contents of the active cell spoken to us. This is much easier than having to 
move the cursor and then doing an <ALT> and <Y> over and over again.
 
To make it tidier we can define a window around the spreadsheet grid and make 
this a highlight window.  This means that text outside the grid which is 
displayed in the highlight colour will not be spoken when the cursor keys are 
depressed.
 
Already we have started to create an environment which enables us to use a 
spreadsheet in a very friendly way. Later we will build on this and consider 
some other possible environments.

12.   -  Monitor Markers

In the earlier lessons you learnt about the twenty six markers.  This lesson 
moves on to an advanced application for  markers: when they are defined as 
monitor markers.  As their name implies, monitor markers  are used by 
Hal Lite to monitor what happens at their position on the screen.

12.1 What can monitor markers do?
 
Before we learn how to use monitor markers let us whet your appetite by 
describing what monitor markers can do.
 
Three occurrences can be detected by a marker.  They are:
 
* when the character at that point becomes the one specified by you

* when the character at that point changes from the one specified by you

* when the character at that point just changes

When a monitor marker is triggered by one of these occurrences it can perform 
a number of actions:

* announce a message

* load a new environment file

* perform one of the tab, carriage return or cursor key functions outlined 
below:

lines
reads the line that the cursor is on.

highlighted text
this has been dealt with in Lesson 4.

to cursor       
reads text on line up to cursor position.

column
reads column number of cursor position.

read two lines
reads the line above the current line and the current line.

read three lines
reads two lines above, one line above and the current line.

read window 0 
through 9
windows will be dealt with later in the manual.

off
no spoken output.

characters
speaks the character at the cursor.

words   
speaks the word at the cursor.

An example of using a monitor marker could be to watch the line 
number indicator on a word processor status line.  It could be set 
to announce the message "new line" every time this number 
changes as you write a document.  A logical extension of this 
would be the announcement of "new page" etc.
 
Having seen what can be done let us now move on to see how to 
go about it.

12.2 Setting up a monitor marker
 
There are three stages involved in setting up monitor markers.
  
12.2.1 Stage 1  - defining the change
 
The first stage involves careful selection of a point on the screen which you 
know will change in some way when you require an action to take place.  We 
have already considered a possible application of a line or page number 
changing on a word processor status line.  Locate the cursor on that position 
within reading mode.  Make use of the <ALT> and <I> command to ensure that 
you are in the correct position.

Now, hit the letter <M> key to set a marker at that point and then tap any 
letter of the alphabet.  In this example we will use the letter <A>.
 
Just to recap, we have positioned marker A at a point on the screen which we 
wish to monitor.  We must now go on to define the type of change to be 
monitored for.
 
Within reading mode, <CTRL> and <W> takes you into the monitor marker menu.  
This menu is rather like the parameter menu and uses the <TAB> key to move 
through the twenty-six monitor markers (represented by letters of the 
alphabet).  Thus, when you first enter the menu, Hal Lite announces "monitor 
marker - a" followed by its present setting which by default is off.  Try 
tabbing through the markers.  Alternatively you can just hit a letter to go 
straight to a monitor marker - for example to set marker V enter the monitor 
marker menu and tap the letter <V>.  Now then, hit <ESC> and the synthesiser 
will say "reading" and you will be returned to reading mode.

Within the monitor marker menu the <SPACE BAR> is used to change the options 
of each monitor marker.  Try re-entering the monitor marker menu and when 
Hal Lite says  monitor marker - A - off" tap the <SPACE BAR>.

With each subsequent tap you will hear the following: "monitor marker - A for 
same", "monitor marker - A for not same", "monitor marker - A for change" and 
finally "monitor marker - A - off".  These same, not same and change options 
refer to an appointed character which we have yet to define (in stage 2, 
below).
 
Thus, the three active options are a shorthand form of writing:
 
* monitor marker A will trigger when it detects the appointed character (same).
 
* monitor marker A will trigger when it detects a change from the appointed 
character (not same), and finally 

* monitor marker A will trigger when it detects any change at all (change).
 
In our example, we are going to use the A marker to tell us when a point on 
the screen changes to the letter X. Thus, our appointed character is the 
letter X and our change option is "monitor marker - A for same".

12.2.2 Stage 2  -  defining the appointed character
 
When Hal Lite speaks "monitor marker - A for same", press the <TAB> key and 
you will be prompted to enter the appointed character with the message 
"character is - O.K.?".  We have to say "no" in response to this question 
because our appointed character is the letter X - so press <N> for "no".  
Hal Lite responds with "type character to watch".  Enter the letter <X>.  
Note: be careful to differentiate between upper and lower case.

As soon as you have entered the appointed character Hal Lite moves on to 
offer a couple of courses of possible action for you to select when the 
character at monitor marker A becomes an X.
 
Please note that it is possible to enter an ASCII number as the appointed 
character.  For example, if you wish the appointed character to be ASCII 191, ®, 
(which is not a spoken character) simply enter the number 191 on the numeric 
key pad whilst keeping the <ALT> key depressed.

12.2.3 Stage 3  -  defining the action
 
Hal Lite allows us to define three types of action which can be taken when 
the point at monitor marker A becomes an X.  They are:
 
* speak a message
* load an environment file
* perform one of the tab, carriage return, cursor key actions
	
In our example we want Hal Lite to read the whole screen (window 0) when the 
letter X appears at monitor marker A.

Just as soon as you have entered the appointed character you are asked 
"message is - O.K.?".  In our example, we do not wish Hal Lite to speak a 
message so we can answer "yes" to this question - tap the letter <Y>.  
Hal Lite now offers us another course of action by asking "file is - O.K.?".  
Again, we can answer <Y> to this question because we do not want Hal Lite to 
load in an environment file.  Finally, Hal Lite moves on to the third series 
of actions possible - the tab, carriage return, cursor key actions.  The 
first of these is "action for monitor A - words".

Now, cycle through these options using the <SPACE BAR>.  They are as follows:

lines
reads the line that the cursor is on.

highlighted text
this has been dealt with in Lesson 4.

to cursor
reads text on line up to cursor position.

column
reads column number of cursor position.

read two lines
reads the line above the current line and the current line.

read three lines
reads two lines above, one line above and the current line.

read window 0 
through 9       
windows will be dealt with later in the manual.

off     
no spoken output.

characters      
speaks the character at the cursor.

words           
speaks the word at the cursor.

In our example, we wish to select the option read window 0 through 9.  Cycle 
through with the <SPACE BAR> until Hal Lite says "read window 0" and then tap 
the <ESC> key, the synthesiser will say "reading" and you will leave the 
monitor marker menu.

12.3 Monitor marker activation
 
In our example we set a point on the screen to be monitored by marker A so 
that if the letter X appeared at that point, Hal Lite would read the entire 
screen.  Of course, you may configure the three variables outlined above in 
any way you wish to suit your particular application.
 
Finally, you need to activate the monitor marker option within the parameter 
menu.  Simply <TAB> through the parameter menu and select the monitor marker 
on option.  From now on any monitor markers that you have set will be in 
operation.

Again we have to stress the need to experiment and practise using monitor 
markers.  They are not always easy to set up but once you have done so it is 
possible to save these settings in an environment file so that you need never 
have to repeat the procedure.  We will look at this in the next lesson.

13.   -  Miscellaneous Commands

If you have worked through all the lessons so far, you will have learnt 
nearly all of Hal Lite's commands.  There still remain a few which will give 
you even more power to configure your system.

13.1 Hal Lite commands and application programs
 
Some application programs use the same <ALT> key commands as Hal Lite does 
in live mode.  This can be a nuisance because Hal Lite obeys the command and 
stops it getting to the other program.  To overcome this Hal Lite uses <ALT> 
and <N> which makes it ignore the next <ALT> key command.  For example if a 
database program uses <ALT> and <L> as a command to move on to the next 
record you will have to enter <ALT> and <N> and then <ALT> and <L>.  Don't 
forget that most programs allow you to re-define such keys - this would be a 
better alternative than having to constantly use the <ALT> and <N> command.

Another method is to turn the Hal Lite Alt keys off.  You can do this with 
<ALT> and <A> from within reading mode. This leaves only <ALT> and <J> 
active in live mode.

13.2 Status report
 
The @ "at" sign in reading mode gives you the status of certain special keys 
such as insert and number lock.  The key status is only mentioned when its 
option is on.

13.3 Saving or loading the Hal Lite prompts and environments
 
There are two types of file that Hal Lite can load or save.  They are as 
follows:

13.3.1 The prompt file
 
The prompt.hal file contains a list of Hal Lite's spoken commands,  for 
example, "period" when you press the "full stop" key on the keyboard.  It is 
possible to edit the prompt file so as to change the wording (See PREDIT). 

So, if you want to change exclamation" to say "exclamation mark" you can do 
so.  It is then possible to have a number of prompt type files which can be 
loaded at any time to suit the application.

There are a number of foreign language prompt files for Hal Lite, if you 
have a Series 2 Synthesiser with additional language ROMs then you can load 
in the appropriate prompt file and it could be set to automatically change the 
active language ROM.  The way that it does this is by the @= command on the 
last line of the file. 

For example if you have two languages,  English and Welsh with English as 
the first ROM then make sure that the English prompt file has the command @=1 
as its last line, and the Welsh ROM has @=2 as its last line.  For multiple 
ROM boards the @ commands in the prompt files should always equal the 
appropriate ROM number. For example number one for English, number two for 
Spanish, number three for Italian and number four for American.
 
To load a prompt file simply enter <ALT> and <F> and in response to "load or 
save" tap the letter <P> key.  Hal Lite will say "prompt".  Now enter the 
prompt file name and press <ENTER>.  All being well the speech synthesiser 
should say "done" and greet you in the language selected.

Hal Lite always starts up by loading in the prompt file named prompt.hal - 
however, any language prompt file can be renamed prompt.ha

13.3.2 The environment file
 
Hal Lite's environment is automatically loaded when Hal Lite is first run to 
give you what is known as the default environment.  The name of this file is 
hal.spc.
 
However, you can change the environment with variations  such as voice speed, 
pitch of speech, parameter changes etc. and it is possible to go on to save 
this environment to disk and subsequently reload it into Hal Lite so that you 
do not have to go to the trouble of modifying the default environment all 
over again.

If you always want to start up in your new environment then save it to the 
file name hal.spc so that it replaces the default hal.spc file.

The <ALT> and <F> command allows you to load or save the Hal Lite environment.  
Once you have adjusted Hal Lite to give optimum output for your application, 
you can save the setting to disk with <ALT> and <F> in live or reading mode.  
After entering this command you are posed the question "load or save?".  
Answer with the letter <S> for "save" and you will be asked for a file name.  
Enter a legal file name and hit <ENTER>.  If the save is satisfactory Hal Lite 
will say "done".  (If there is any problem Hal Lite informs you "save failed").  
Please note that on some occasions Hal Lite will not perform the save until 
you come out of reading mode.

To load that environment back into Hal Lite use <ALT> and <F> again but this 
time answer <L> for "load".  Again give the file name and the data will be 
loaded.  If the load is satisfactory, the synthesiser will say "done", 
otherwise it will say "load failed".  An environment file can be loaded 
automatically by means of monitor markers - see Lesson 5 of this manual.

An alternative way to the hal.spc method of loading on boot up is to add the 
filename to your batch file as shown below:
 
HLITE  -fxxxx
 
where xxxx is a legal file name.  It is important to separate the environment 
file name from the Hal Lite name by a space and a dash and the letter "f".

If we had saved a spreadsheet environment with the file name calc.hal then 
the command line to load in this environment with Hal Lite is as follows:
 
HLITE  -fcalc.hal
 
Try saving an environment and then loading it back into Hal Lite using the 
<ALT> and <F>, the hal.spc and the command line methods.
 
It is always possible to check the name of your current environment file by 
tapping the <?> key when in reading mode.  This is very useful when working 
on a number of environments which are to be loaded and unloaded by monitor 
markers.

13.4 The static cursor
 
The static cursor facility available from within Hal Lite's parameter menu 
is normally turned off.  If, however, you turn it on, Hal Lite will monitor 
cursor movement, watching for a time when the cursor remains static.  When 
this happens it will perform one of the operations from the usual tab, return, 
cursor key actions list, that is, read - lines, highlighted text, to cursor, 
column number, two lines, three lines, window 0 through 9, off, characters, 
words.  This choice of options is available from the parameter menu under 
the heading static does.

The final variable concerned with the static cursor facility is that of 
static wait.  This represents the length of time the cursor remains 
stationary before Hal Lite takes any action.  The static wait parameter is 
to be found within the parameter menu and allows you to choose options 
between 0 and 9.  Each increment represents approximately 0.5 seconds wait.  
It is best to experiment with this facility.

13.5 The soft cursor
 
Some programs use a soft cursor character such as ASCII 4, *, to show the 
cursor position on the screen - the real cursor being somewhere quite 
different.  For example, if you are using an early version of MS-WORD you 
will find that wherever you are in the document the <ALT> and <L> command 
will always read the same line.  This is the line where the true cursor is 
parked.
 
To overcome this problem, Hal Lite has a soft cursor facility which is 
activated by using <CTRL> and <C> within reading mode.  Simply enter <CTRL> 
and <C> and enter the soft cursor character.  From now on Hal Lite will 
consider this as the real cursor.  If this character is a high ASCII number 
then enter it via the numeric key pad whilst the <ALT> key is depressed.  If 
the ASCII value is 32 (space character) then determine the foreground and 
background colour of the soft cursor, set the highlight text to this value 
and then enter <CTRL> and <C> and hit a function key.  If you need to 
restrict this character to within a window then make it an output window.

The Alt key method of entering high ASCII numbers can also be used with the 
find command as follows.

Within reading mode, tap the letter <F> key and Hal Lite will prompt you with 
the word "find".  Now, with the "numlock" key on and the <ALT> key depressed 
enter the ASCII number on the numeric keypad.  As soon as you release the 
<ALT> key Hal Lite will initiate the search and announce "found" when it comes 
across the character.

14.   -  Creating Useful Environments

You have already seen how a spreadsheet can be made to work in a friendly 
way.  By making these `friendly' settings we have in effect created an 
environment file.  This lesson considers the spreadsheet and some other 
applications in more detail, with further reference to environment files.  
Remember that you do not necessarily have to create your own environment files 
as they have probably already been written for your application, and are 
available from Dolphin on request.

14.1 The word processor
 
It must be emphasised that Hal Lite will work with most off-the-shelf 
packages such as WordStar, DisplayWrite, Smartware and WordPerfect.  When 
word processing with Hal Lite the best configuration is probably to have the 
cursor keys reading a line at a time.  Also set the muting parameter option 
to on if using key echo characters.  Most word processors use the <BkSp> key 
to delete characters but occasionally the <DEL> key is used. 

You can make this give intelligent feedback by setting it to either delete 
previous or delete current in reading mode.  Tapping the <DEL> key will cause 
it to toggle between these two options.  The original WordStar uses the 
delete previous setting.  Experiment with this.

Sometimes it is very hard to determine where exactly the cursor is when 
editing.  The <ALT> and <K> key is a real boon here - it reads the current 
line to the cursor.  After editing check on continuity with <ALT> and <L>.
 
If you are a fast typist who uses speech then you might prefer to set keyboard 
echo to words rather than characters - but do not forget to turn the muting 
to cursors.  Try gradually increasing the speed of speech output from your 
synthesiser and remember that many users find listening via headphones allows 
them to comprehend very fast speech output.
 
Many word processors have help screens that always appear in the same place 
on the screen.  This is an ideal opportunity to construct a simple window 
around this area for immediate access using the <ALT> and <P> command.

It is a good idea to construct a window around the status line too - then you 
can check your page or line number with an <ALT> and <P> command without 
having to enter reading mode.  Again some packages use colours extensively, 
for example underlined text appears in blue. It is a simple matter to restrict 
output to that colour and check the text.
 
When checking back through a document using the down cursor key it is a good 
idea to have the "read capitals" option on, enabling you to check for case 
errors.
 
Some spell checkers throw up their suggested alternative spellings in a 
different colour so use the <ALT> and <R> command to restrict colour and 
then use the find command in screen reading to get straight to the first 
suggested word.

If your word processor uses a menu system where you have to use the cursor 
keys to highlight an option then determine this highlight colour and set it 
to be Hal Lite's highlight colour.  You could then configure the cursor keys 
to read highlighted text but this could be inconvenient as they are used so 
much when editing. 

Another way is to use the cursor keys and then do an <ALT> and <Y> to read 
the highlighted option.

Don't forget that with many of these menu driven programs the initial letter 
of the option will do the same thing as highlighting it. 

Of course you can have more than one environment used within the package - 
use monitor markers to load them in and out automatically.  Monitor markers 
can also be used to read out messages.
 
The static cursor can be of great help when using the word processor's "find" 
command - you can configure it, for example, to read the line of text 
containing a "found" word as soon as the cursor becomes stationary.  For 
example <CTRL> and <Q>, then <F> in WordStar. 

14.2 The spreadsheet
 
Hal Lite can be configured to enable easy access to most of the popular 
spreadsheets such as PC-Calc, Lotus 1-2-3, Smartware and SuperCalc.  Please 
note, however, that a colour card is almost an essential prerequisite.  With 
a spreadsheet the first thing to do is construct a window around the grid to 
exclude all the co-ordinate letters and numbers.  Make this a highlight 
window.  Now determine the foreground and background colours of the active 
cell and make these the highlight colour. 

Finally configure the cursor keys to read highlighted text. 

Now you have an environment which reads the contents of the active cell as 
you cursor around.
 
It might be worth defining windows around the status lines so that you can 
refer to them immediately from live mode with the <ALT> and <P> command.

Another useful option would be to set monitor markers on the co-ordinates 
status line.  They could be set to read them out as you move around to keep 
track of your whereabouts.

Finally, some spreadsheets give help screens in the form of two columns 
separated by a central vertical line.  Such a screen layout is difficult to 
read a line at a time so it is best to divide the screen into two windows 
which can be accessed individually.

14.3 The database
 
There seem to be almost as many databases on the market today as there are 
word processors.  However, most of them can be readily accessed using 
Hal Lite.  Examples include Smartware, dBase and PC-File.

Like spreadsheets, the use of a colour card in the PC can add considerably to 
Hal Lite's flexibility when tailoring its environment for use with a database.
 
A useful setting when entering data is to configure the return key to read 
to cursor.  This means that as you make entries on a record the field name 
will be spoken thereby enabling you to keep track of your progress.

When using a database to retrieve information try to make use of colour.  For 
example, the first field entry on a record is often printed in a different 
colour to the other fields.  You could make this Hal Lite's highlight colour 
and configure this to be spoken when it appears on the screen.
 
If fields appear in the same screen position at all times then windows can 
be utilised so that you can access data by using the <ALT> and <P> command 
in live mode.

Do not forget the value of an output window to restrict spoken data to a 
minimum.  Monitor markers and the static cursor facility can be helpful to 
let you know when a data search has been completed.

14.4 Communications software
 
If you wish to use a modem on a standard computer then it will probably have 
to run off the serial port.  This is unfortunate for speech users because it 
is the preferred port for the synthesiser.  

There are two methods for overcoming the problem.
 
The first method of overcoming the problem is to purchase a second serial 
port.  These cards are not very expensive.  Hal Lite needs to be instructed 
to use this second port when the program is loaded.
 
The second method is to use the internal version of the speech sysnthesiser, 
the PC 2 card.  Or better still use a Fax/Modem card instead of using a 
modem connected  to a serial port.

Do not forget that you have some control over the output of communications 
packages with the screen parameter and by the use of output windows.
 
If you require any suggestions regarding suitable communications software 
please contact us.

15. -  Creating Exceptions Dictionaries

This lesson tells you how to teach Hal Lite exactly what to say when it comes 
across a particular string of characters on the screen.

15.1 Exceptions

A lot of text that we read contains abbreviations or acronyms. When you are 
using Hal Lite and it tries to speak strings of characters such as `etc.' or 
`Mr', the sounds that are made can be unintelligible.  An Exceptions 
Dictionary allows you to teach Hal Lite to pronounce these items as something 
that you will understand.  For instance, you may want Hal Lite to speak the 
word "control" every time it comes across "ctrl" on the screen, or say 
"Limited" every time it comes across "Ltd.".

Another use is to correct mispronunciations.
e.g. When Hal Lite sees the word "ASCII" it says "ass see", but you could 
define it to say "ask key" instead.

15.2 Exceptions Dictionary

Associated with the Exceptions Dictionary are two Hal Lite command line 
parameters:

-afilename
where filename is the Exceptions Dictionary's filename
							       
-m##
where ## is the size in kilobytes of the largest dictionary needed

At least one of these 2 parameters must be used if exceptions are required.  
If a filename is given then this file becomes the Exceptions Dictionary and 
the default dictionary english.dic is not used.  Also, the option words in 
the parameter menu must be set to on, for the exceptions to be spoken.

To load an Exceptions Dictionary from Hal Lite's live mode. Depress the 
<ALT> key, and whilst it is depressed tap the letter <F> key, the 
synthesiser should now respond by saying "load or save".  Tap the letter <A> 
key, and the synthesiser will say "words". Now type in the filename of the 
Exceptions Dictionary you want to load and then press the <ENTER> key.  If 
the Exceptions Dictionary has been successfully loaded the synthesiser will 
say "done".  Otherwise the synthesiser will say "load failed".

N.B.  If you did not use the -m## parameter to set aside some memory for the 
Exceptions Dictionary, then you will not be able to load an Exceptions 
Dictionary in this way.  This is because there will not be enough memory for 
it to be loaded.

15.3 DEDIT - Exceptions Dictionary editor

This program will create or edit an Exceptions Dictionary.  The program has 
its own prompt file (not required for English alphabet) which contains not 
only the program prompts but also details of the alphabet to be used (the 
order and, for each character, its lower case and uppercase forms).  The other 
prompt files are intended for languages other than English.

DEDIT has two command line parameters:

-afilename
defines the Exceptions Dictionary  (english.dic is the default)

-pfilename
defines DEDIT's prompt file (prompt.dic is the default)

An Exceptions Dictionary consists of a list of exceptions listed in order.  
Each exception consists of a search string, and a replacement string.  There 
are 2 types of exception:

1.      The search string is replaced ONLY if it is a whole word.  
This type of exception is distinguished in the editor with an "arrows both 
way" character.  A whole word is delimited by a space or carriage return.

2.      The search string is replaced if it "starts" a word (or it is a whole 
word).  This type of exception is distinguished in the editor with an "arrow 
left" character.

A "string" is a set of up to 38 characters.  These can be anything that the 
computer can accept, except, in the search string a space is not permitted and 
any lower case letter is converted to its upper case equivalent.  To enter 
unusual codes depress the <ALT> key, and whilst it is depressed type in the 
decimal code on the number pad.  Finally, release the <ALT> key.

In the editor keys have the following meanings:

<F1>
Display the help screen

<F4>
Switch between displaying spaces as a dot and not

<up arrow>
Move up one entry

<down arrow>
Move down one entry

<PgUp>
Move up a screenful of entries

<PgDn>
Move down a screenful of entries

<CTRL> and <PgUp>
Move to first entry

<CTRL> and <PgDn>
Move to last entry
 
When you are not editing an entry:

<F2>
Find an exception - key in the search string and press <ENTER>.

<ENTER>
Start editing the current entry.

<CTRL> and <ENTER>
Replace the current entry.

<INS>
Insert a new entry into the dictionary.

<DEL>/<BkSp>
Delete the current entry.

<F9>
Save the dictionary.

<ESC>
Save the dictionary and finish the program.

<Q>
Quit the program without saving the changes.

When you are editing an entry:

<F3>
Switch between  1) "whole word only" and  2) "start of word"

<DEL>
Delete the character at the cursor.

<Left arrow>
Move the cursor to the left.

<Right arrow>
Move the cursor to the right.

<HOME>
Move the cursor to the start of the current string.

<END>
Move the cursor to the end of the current string.

<ENTER>/<INS>
Throw away any editing done to the current entry.

You will notice that some exceptions are duplicated e.g. "AVE" and "AVE.".  
This is done to make "AVE." say "Avenue period" when screen punctuation is on.  
If the exception was entered without this case, then with screen punctuation 
on it would not say "period".

If you have a new exception to enter press the key marked <INS>.  If you now 
depress the <ALT> key, and whilst it is depressed tap the letter <L> key (to 
read a line).  Hal Lite should respond by saying "start of word is".  If you 
want the exception to be a whole word then tap the key marked <F3>.  You can 
check this by using <ALT> and <L>, as above to read the line.  Hal Lite 
should now say "whole word is".

Type the word you want to replace and then press <ENTER>.  Then type the 
replacement string.  Again using <ALT> and <L> will read out what you have 
typed. Finally, press the <ENTER> key and this exception will be entered in 
the dictionary.

If you wish to edit an already existing exception, use the up and down cursor 
keys until the exception you want to edit is spoken and then press the 
<ENTER> key. 

That exception will then be used as a template for a new exception.  Edit 
your exception, pressing the <ENTER> key after you have entered the word to 
replace, and again after its replacement string.  <ALT> and <L> will read out 
the exception currently being edited.

N.B.  If when editing you change the string that will be replaced, when done, 
this will be added to your Exceptions Dictionary alongside the exception you 
used as a template.

15.4 PREDIT  -  Prompt Editor

This is a simplified text editor which does not allow deletion of lines in 
the file and allows you to edit a line and see the previous version at the 
same time.  It is also limited to files of less than 1000 lines.

The program has its own prompt file which contains the program prompts.

The command line for this program is of the form:

PREDIT  oldfile  newfile  -pfilename

oldfile
Optional:  The file you wish to edit.  (prompt.hal is the default)

newfile
Optional:  The name you wish the file to be saved under.

-pfilename
Optional:  PREDIT's prompt file. (prompt.pre is the default).

Any character code can be entered into a line except for codes 0, 10, or 13.  
Empty lines are not permitted and will always be replaced by a single space 
character.

In the editor keys have the following meanings:-

<F1>
Display the help screen.  Subsequent presses switch between the 2 help screens

<F4>
Switch between displaying spaces as a dot and not

When you are not editing an entry:

<up arrow>
Move up one entry

<down arrow>
Move down one entry

<PgUp>
Move up a screenful of entries

<PgDn>
Move down a screenful of entries

<CTRL> and <PgUp>
Move to first entry

<CTRL> and <PgDn>
Move to last entry

<ENTER>/<INS>
Start editing the current entry.

<DEL>/<BkSp>
Delete the current entry.

<ESC>
Save the dictionary and finish the program.

<Q>
Quit the program without saving the changes.

When you are editing an entry:

<BkSp>
Delete the character before the cursor.

<DEL>
Delete the character at the cursor.

<left arrow>
Move the cursor to the left.

<right arrow>
Move the cursor to the right.

<HOME>
Move the cursor to the start of the current line.

<END>
Move the cursor to the end of the current line.

<ENTER>/<INS>
Finish editing the current entry.

<up arrow>
Finish and edit next line up.

<down arrow>
Finish and edit next line down.

<ESC>
Throw away any editing done to the current entry.

Note:  Lines can be up to 239 characters long.  All 239 are displayed whilst 
you are editing a line but only the first 78 are displayed elsewhere.

If you are finishing or quitting the program there is an "Are you sure?" 
prompt.  Answer by pressing the <Y> key for yes, or any other key to cancel 
the action.

16.   -  Re-defining Hal Lite's keys

This lesson deals with an advanced feature for redefining the keystrokes that 
Hal Lite uses.  This is useful when running Hal Lite with an application 
that use the same keystrokes.

Important:  The HAL keystroke re-definition feature should only be used by 
more confident users.  If you are in any doubt at all about this feature, 
then please feel free to phone Dolphin and ask for the HelpDesk.

16.1 Hal Lite's Keystroke Re-definition File

If you want to re-define the keystrokes that Hal Lite uses, you can create a 
Hal Lite keystroke re-definition file called  AAA.ZZZ.

(AAA.ZZZ must be an ASCII text file.  You can create ASCII text files using 
a text editor such as EDLIN, EDIT, or even WordStar [in non-document mode].)

The layout of each line of the  AAA.ZZZ  file is:

current-key             new-key

The current-key/new-key pair can consist of three types of keystrokes, can be 
entered in upper or lower case, and are separated by one or more spaces, or a 
carriage return.

Note:  Each current-key must have a new-key equivalent.
The three types of keystrokes are:

1.  An "Alt" keystroke, defined in the  AAA.ZZZ  file as ALT_A to ALT_Z, or a 
"Control" keystroke, defined in the  AAA.ZZZ  file as CTRL_A to CTRL_Z.

Note that an "Alt" or "Control" keystroke is entered as ALT or CTRL, followed 
by an _ (underscore), followed by a key A to Z with no spaces in between.  
e.g.

ALT_J  ALT_E

This means that in the  AAA.ZZZ  file, the keystroke to go into screen reading 
mode is now <ALT> and <E>, instead of <ALT> and <J>.

2.  Another type of keystroke is a single character obtainable from the 
keyboard.

e.g.

	P  J

This means that in the  AAA.ZZZ file, the keystroke to get into the parameter 
menu within screen reading mode is now <J>.  (It used to be <P>).

3.  You can also specify a re-definition for a keystroke which is used inside 
one of Hal Lite's facilities.  Each of the keystrokes in the facilities are 
preceded by a single letter, to identify the facility, and _ (underscore).  
Here are a list of the facilities:


When defining a window
W_

When filing
F_ 
(exceptions, prompts, environments)

When inside Hal Lite's restrict colour facility
R_ 

Hal Lite's Yes/No keystroke
Y_

e.g.
	F_A  E

This means in the  AAA.ZZZ  file, that when Filing (<ALT> and <F>), the 
keystroke to load an Exceptions Dictionary is now <E>, instead of <A>.

The reason for using F_A instead of A, is that you must distinguish between:

* <A> in filing, which loads an Exceptions Dictionary.

AND

* <A> in screen reading mode, which gives the attributes of the character 
under the cursor.

16.2 An Example

Here is an example  AAA.ZZZ  file:

ALT_J  ALT_E
F_A  E
W_S  B
R_I  B
Y_N  Z

NOTE:  The options F_, W_, R_  and  Y_  are mandatory, in order to fully 
define a keystroke within a facility.  The lines in the example  AAA.ZZZ  file 
have the following meanings:

ALT_J  ALT_E
screen reading is now entered using ALT_E.

F_A  E
When Filing, Exceptions loaded using E

W_S  B
When defining windows, B is "start of window"

R_I  B
When using restrict B is used for intense

Y_N  Z
Keystroke for "No" is Z

17. Speaking Numbers

The numbers prompt file defines how strings of numbers are spoken by Hal Lite.  
The first thirty lines of the numbers prompt file defines how numbers are 
split when they are read.

The first line of the file defines what characters are used for the decimal 
point, separator and minus sign.  The second and third lines defines what is 
said for the decimal point and minus characters.

Line four defines the maximum number of digits that Hal Lite will try to 
break up into tens, hundreds, thousands and millions.

The lines following that up to line thirty define how the digits are actually 
split.  The symbols used have the following meanings:

0       zero digit
+       non-zero digit
?       either zero or non-zero digit

Some Examples

Line six: /000000000 thousand million defines that if a digit, say n, is 
followed by nine zeros then it is "n thousand million".

Line seven:  /0000000++ thousand million and defines that if a digit, again 
lets say n, is followed by seven zeros and the last two digits and non-zero 
then it is, "n thousand million and" the two non-zero digits.

Lines thirty one onwards in the numbers file just define what is said for 
each of the number zero to ninety nine.
