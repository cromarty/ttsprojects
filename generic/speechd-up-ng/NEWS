Version 0.4

 * Internationalization for all unibyte encodings! It is now possible to use
   Speakup with different languages, as long as the written form is representable
   in a unibyte (e.g. iso-8859-) encoding and the language is supported by your
   synthesizer. Please see the documentation.
	(thanks to Gilles Casse)

 * Keys and characters typed by the user are now a separate event for Speech
   Dispatcher. This allows the various synthesizers to do caching, their own
   language appropriate punctuation and capital letters handling. Also sound
   icons for letters and symbols are now supported.

    index marking, thanks to Michael McDonald.
