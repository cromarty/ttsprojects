The requirements:
=================

You will need these components to compile and run speechd-up: 
 - Speech Dispatcher (http://www.freebsoft.org)
     (including libspeechd.so.2 or newer -- part of Speech Dispatcher 0.6 or 0.6.1)
 - Speakup (http://www.linux-speakup.org)
	(you need to install a newer version if you want to make
	use of the Read All command and internationalization)
 - texinfo (you can live without it if you use just `make speechd-up', but
	you won't have the documentation installed)

If you are building from CVS, you also need these:
 - automake 1.7+, autoconf, pkg-config and libtool

We recommend also installing these packages:
 - festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)

Building SpeechD-Up:
===========================

Please read the file BUGS first so that you are aware of the possible
issues.

! You need to upgrade to Speech Dispatcher 0.6 or 0.6.1 before trying to
compile and install this version of SpeechD-Up !

To compile SpeechD-Up, simply extract the distribution archive and
change to speechd-up-0.4 directory and run "make all" command as
follows:

 $ tar -xzvf speechd-up-0.4.tar.gz
 $ cd speechd-up-0.4

Only *if you are building from CVS*, you must run buid.sh

 $ ./build.sh

If build.sh fails, please triple-check you really have the tools listed above
in their specified versions. This is the most common source of problems. Avoid
them by using the distribution tarball, which doesn't need this step, whenever
you can.

Proceed like ordinary

 $ ./configure
 $ make all

If everything worked right, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running (as root):

 $ make install

Making SpeakUp work with SpeechdUp and software synthesis
=========================================================

Please see the info documentation you obtained with SpeechD-Up
(info speechd-up) or go to http://www.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd-up .

Testing
=======

Next try to run Speechd-Up as a standalone application
in the probe mode to see if everything is ok:

 $ speechd-up --run-single --probe

if you hear a message, then SpeechD-Up itself is working correctly
and you can try to connect it to Speakup

 $ speechd-up --run-single

Later, you can execute it without the --run-single parameter, preferably from a
/etc/init.d script.

If something doesn't work, please first look into the file BUGS in this diretory
and then contact us on speechd@lists.freebsoft.org or send a bug report to
speechd@bugs.freebsoft.org.
