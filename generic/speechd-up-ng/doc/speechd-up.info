   `spechd-up' is a very simple simple interface from Speakup to Speech
Dispatcher making it possible to use Speakup with software synthesis.
Speakup is a kernel-based screen reader allowing blind and visually
impaired people to use the computer.

1 Installation
**************

(This is not a description on how-to install SpeechD-Up itself, this is
a description of all the necessary steps to make SpeakUp work with
software synthesis using Speechd-Up. For how to install SpeechD-Up
itself, please see the file `INSTALL' in the distribution tarball.)

   SpeakUp can't use software synthesis directly because SpeakUp lives
in the so called "kernel space" and software synthesizers live in the so
called "user space". These are two different parts of your system and
the communication between them is quite difficult. The approach to make
SpeakUp work with software synthesis is the following one: Speakup
provides a device, usually called `/dev/softhsynth', where it sends all
the commands to the synthesizers. Then there is a very simple
application (or rather a daemon) called Speechd-Up listening on this
device and passing all the requests for synthesis to Speech Dispatcher,
which then in turn talks to your chosen synthesizer (be it Festival,
Flite or something else).

   If you want to use SpeakUp with software synthesis, you need to setup
all this chain. It might not be easy, but you might later use Speech
Dispatcher also for other accessibility applications. Or otherwise:
chances are that you already have a great part of this up and running.
Let's suppose you are starting from the scratch (if you have something
already running, just make sure this is true and skip the step).

  1. Install your favorite speech synthesizer

     To be able to use software synthesis, you first need to install
     some software synthesizer. We strongly recommend a Free Software
     package "Festival" for it's many capabilities, support of multiple
     languages, quite good quality of some voices and quick responses.
     However, you might chose any of the synthesizers supported by
     Speech Dispatcher (please see
     `http://www.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd/speech-dispatcher_10.html#SEC10')

     Read the installation instructions for your chosen synthesizer and
     install it. There are Debian packages for both Festival and Flite.

  2. Make sure the synthesizer works

     There is usually some simple way how to check if the synthesizer
     works.  For festival, run `festival' and type in:

     `(SayText "Hello world")'

     Don't continue unless you know the synthesizer works.

  3. Install Speech Dispatcher

     You can get more information about Speech Dispatcher from
     `http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd'. You can either use a
     pre-compiled package (see your distribution repositories) or
     download the tarball from the above internet address and follow
     the instructions in the file `INSTALL'.

     If you are running Debian, you can install the following packages:
     `speech-dispatcher', `libspeechd1' and `libspeechd1-dev'. The
     latest one is important too since you will have to compile
     SpeechD-Up yourself.

  4. Make sure Speech Dispatcher works correctly

     You can test whether Speech Dispatcher works with a simple client
     called `spd-say' distributed along with Speech Dispatcher. (You
     might later find this package useful for many practical purposes.)
     It has many parameters, so you can even test if the rate and pitch
     settings work correctly etc.

          spd-say "Hello world!"
          spd-say -r 90 -p -70 "This is quick and deep"

     If this doesn't work, please examine Speech Dispatcher
     documentation for possible problems (`info speech-dispatcher').
     You might want to see the logfiles of Speech Dispatcher itself and
     of its output module you are using.

  5. Install Speechd-Up

     You can download Speechd-Up source code from
     `http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-up'. Unpack it with `tar -xvzf
     speechd-up-0.1.tar.gz' and follow the instructions in the file
     `INSTALL' in the source tree.

  6. Make sure SpeechD-Up can communicate with Speech Dispatcher

     You can test if SpeechD-Up can communicate with Speech Dispatcher
     by executing (as root)

          speechd-up --run-single --probe

     If you hear something, everything in SpeechD-Up works except
     connecting to the SpeakUp's device (which was not attempted in
     this test).

  7. Install SpeakUp

     You have probably done that already, but you must make sure you
     compiled SpeakUp with support of software synthesis. You must have
     SpeakUp compiled with the `softsynth' module and you must create
     the appropriate device with

          cd /dev
          mknod softsynth c 10 26

     Please see `http://www.linux-speakup.org/' for how to obtain and
     install SpeakUp. You might also want to look at the Speakup's User
     Guide here: `http://www.linux-speakup.org/spkguide.txt'

     After having installed Speakup, if `softsynth' is your default
     synthesis device, you must switch to it:

          echo sftsyn >/proc/speakup/synth_name

     This should load the appropriate kernel module (if compiled as a
     module) automatically.

     If you run into problems here, please examine `modprobe -l') for
     the `speakup_sftsyn' module and/or try to load it manually with
     `modprobe'. If this doesn't work, there is some problem with your
     instalation of Speakup.

  8. Make sure SpeechD-Up works

     Now you are at the point when you can invoke SpeechD-Up as an
     application in the foreground and see if everything works ok.

          speechd-up -s

     The application should keep running and you should hear something.
     When you switch to another console, you should be able to use
     SpeakUp normally with your software synthesis.

     If this doesn't work, please look at SpeechD-Ups logfile in
     `/var/log/speechd-up.log'. You can also increase the loging level
     of SpeechD-Up as shown bellow

          speechd-up -s -l 5

     and examine the logs again.

  9. Make Speech Dispatcher and SpeechD-Up start automatically

     This part is distribution specific. It can be left out provided
     you will manually 1) start your synthesizer 2) start
     Speech-Dispatcher 3) switch Speakup to the sftsyn device 4) start
     SpeechD-Up each time you want to use software synthesis with
     Speakup (in this order).

     Under Debian, Speech Dispatcher already starts automatically from
     `/etc/init.d/speech-dispatcher' and it should not be difficult to
     create `/etc/init.d/speechd-up' by modifying the script for Speech
     Dispatcher and then adding a link to it to
     `/etc/rc2.d/S21speechd-up'. You must only make sure it starts
     *after* Speech Dispatcher.

     If this doesn't work, please test again if all the components work
     well as described above.

 10. It's somehow slow etc...

     You might find the new software synthesis is rather slow with
     SpeakUp compared to the hardware synthesizers, and they have some
     other deficiencies. On today's hardware, this is not a fault of
     Speech Dispatcher or software synthesis in general. Speakup was
     not formerly designed with software synthesis in mind and neither
     now this is its main focus.  Please don't think software synthesis
     is generally inferior to hardware synthesis because of this. We
     actually believe quite the opposite is true: The hardware
     synthesizer, unless they are programable, will never achieve the
     huge possibilities of extensible software synthesizers.  See *Note
     Problems::

2 Invoking
**********

Usage: `speechd-up [options]'

`-d or --run-deamon'
     Run as a deamon in the background.

`-s or --run-single'
     Run as an application on the foreground.

`-l or --log-level'
     Sets the logging level. Accepted values are numbers 1 to 5. Five
     means the most verbose logging.

`-L or --log-file'
     Specifies the path to the file where logs are stored.

`-D or --device'
     Selects the device where Speakup sends it's output.

`-c or --coding'
     Indicates which character coding your console uses. For possible
     values, please see `iconv -list'. This option is important if your
     console is not in iso-8859-1! (It doesn't work with "utf-8" and
     other multibyte encoding because of kernel related issues with this
     encoding. You must run your console in a unibyte encoding like for
     example one of the "iso-8859-*" set, sorry.)

`-t or --dont-init-tables'
     SpeechD-Up tries to init some Speakups /proc tables on its start.
     Most important, it changes /proc/characters and /proc/chartab so
     that punctuation, capital letters recognition and various other
     language dependent things are handled inside Speech Dispatcher and
     in the synthesizer. This is crucial for internationalization. You
     can however disable this if you want to modify the tables manually
     for some reason and don't like speechd-up overwriting them. (Do
     not expect Speakup to work for other languages than English in
     that case, unless you know what you are doing and can do the
     necessary changes manually.)

`-p or --probe'
     Runs SpeechD-Up in the probe mode. This means that SpeechD-Up will
     do everything as as ordinary, but won't try to open the SpeakUp
     device. It just speaks a message and terminates (indicating so in
     the logfiles). This is meant for testing.

`-v or --version'
     Print version and copyright info.

`-h or --help'
     Print a short help.

   Examples:

   If the device where Speakup talks to userspace is `/dev/sftsyn2' and
your console is in `iso-8859-2', then you can use:

     speechd-up --device="/dev/sftsyn2/" --coding "iso-8859-2"

   Please use this for debugging or sending bug-reports
     speechd-up -s -l 5 -L "/tmp/speechd-up.log"

3 Problems
**********

There are many known problems with Speakup/SpeechD-Up. You might want
to consider using some user-space assistive technologies if you want to
use software synthesis on the console. Such technologies are
speechd-el, Emacspeak, SuSE Blinux and Yasr. We however believe the
Speakup/SpeechD-Up combination is useful even though it has the
described deficiencies.

   * (Fixed: Speaking characters and keys is slow)

     The original issue was fixed (but see bellow). If you are still
     not happy with the performance while reading characters and typing
     in, then you are using a synthesizer which is both slow and
     lacking support for caching (use Festival, it does caching with
     Speech Dispatcher and keys reading is instant).

   * Characters behave like KEYS for synthesizer configuration

     The way Speakup passes individual characters makes it impossible
     to tell whether this character originated as a key or while the
     user was moving the cursor on the screen and the already present
     letters are being read. We believe it is important to carry the
     proper information when pressing keys (like capitalization), so
     SpeechD-Up handles these messages as keys.

     Also space, tab and various other whitespace characters are not
     reported as a characters/keys as this is impossible to achieve
     with current Speakups implementation. It is impossible if the word
     "space" in input originated by the user pressing the SPACE key or
     by encountering this word inside a document being read on the
     screen.

   * (Fixed: It doesn't speak my language / it uses some weird
     character set)

     If you still experience this issue, you are probably doing one of
     this

        * Using a wide character encoding like UTF-8. This is not
          supported for inherent issues with wide characters inside the
          kernel.

        * Not running `speechd-up' with the `-c' parameter and
          specifying the proper character set your console uses.

        * Running `speechd-up' with the `-t' or `--dont-init-tables'.
          This option is incompatible with internationalization.

     If this is not true, please contact us on
     <speechd@bugs.freebsoft.org>.

   * The spelling/punctuation modes of my favorite synthesizer don't
     work.

     Speakup uses it's own very simple spelling and punctuation
     substitution and doesn't allow the TTS to use it's own
     user-specified rules.

   * It doesn't work in UTF-8

     UTF-8 should work as long as you only use characters encountered
     in the basic ASCII. So English should work. But Speakup doesn't
     really support UTF-8 in any way (nor it can, there is no UTF-8
     support inside the kernel - just workarounds targeted at visual
     interpretation; the kernel virtual terminal drivers contain many
     barriers for accessibility).

   * Punctuation and capital letters recognition doesn't properly work

     This is an issue again related to Speakups design. It is currently
     being worked on.

   * I can't switch languages or synthesizers on fly

     The way the interface Speakup - Speech Dispatcher is designed,
     this is not possible.  You can switch them statically in Speech
     Dispatcher's configuration though. If you use SpeakUp's
     identification "*:speechd-up:*" you can even choose a synthesizer
     specifically for Speakup.

   * Any other more advanced thing doesn't work or something is too
     slow or ...  There are many problems for software speech with how
     this interface is done and with how Speakup is designed. It's
     probably still better to use Speakup with a hardware synthesizer,
     if you have the possibility. Speakup was not designed with user
     space software synthesis in mind and the necessary changes would
     probably be too difficult now. There were many important design
     decisions made which are very reasonable for hardware
     synthesizers, but they just don't mix well with software synthesis.

     On the other hand, experience shows people still find this
     interface to software speech synthesis useful, mostly because of
     lack of anything else. Also, it seems the future of accessibility
     technologies lies in the software synthesis (extensible, etc.) as
     machines get faster. That's the reason why we provide this
     application and we will try to help you if you have problems or
     questions.

5 How You Can Help
******************

If you want to contribute to the development of Speech Dispatcher, we
will be very happy if you do so. Please contact us on
<speechd@lists.freebsoft.org>.

   There is a short, definitively not exhaustive, list of how you can
help us and other users.

   * _Donate money:_ We are a non-profit organization and we can't work
     without funding. Brailcom, o.p.s. created Speech Dispatcher and
     speechd-up and also works on other projects to help blind and
     visually impaired users of computers (like speechd-el). We build
     on Free Software and GNU/Linux, because we believe this is the
     right way. But it won't be possible when we have no money.
     Currently, funding is the main limiting factor for us in
     developing more and better accessibility solutions.
     `http://www.freebsoft.org/'

   * _Report bugs:_ Every user, even if he can't give us money and he is
     not a programmer, can help us very much by just using our software
     and telling us about the bugs and inconveniences he encounters. A
     good user community that reports bugs is a crucial part of
     development of a good Free Software package.  We can't test our
     software under all circumstances and on all platforms, so each
     constructive bug report is highly appreciated. You can report bugs
     in SpeechD-Up on <speechd@bugs.freebsoft.org>.

   * _Help us with project:_ Please look at `http://www.freebsoft.org/'
     to find information about our projects. There is a plenty of work
     still to be done for the blind and visually impaired people to
     make their work with computers easier.

   * _Spread a word about Speech Dispatcher and Free Software:_ You can
     help us, and the whole community around Free Software, just by
     telling your friends about the amazing world of Free Software. It
     doesn't have to be just about Speech Dispatcher, you can tell them
     about other project or about Free Software in general. Remember
     that Speech Dispatcher could only arise out of understanding of
     some people of the principles and ideas behind Free Software. And
     this is mostly the same for the rest of the Free Software world.
     See `http://www.gnu.org/' for more information about GNU/Linux and
     Free Software.

Appendix A GNU General Public License
*************************************

                         Version 2, June 1991
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program,"
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification.")  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you."

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version," you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 20YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Appendix B GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002
     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

B.0.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
