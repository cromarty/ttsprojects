This is the SpeechD-Up project. It is a part of the Free(b)soft
project (http://www.freebsoft.org), which is intended to allow blind
and visually impaired people to work with computers and the Internet
based on free software.

SpeechD-Up provides an interface daemon between Speakup (kernel based
screen reader) and Speech Dispatcher (common interface to speech
synthesis). Using SpeechD-Up, you can make Speakup work with software
synthesizers like Flite or Festival. This interface is in no way optimal
and it suffers of many problems. Some users still find it useful.

To build and install speechd-up and all of it's components, read the file INSTALL
