emacspeak protocol parser using Flex and Bison
==============================================

Files:

parser.y
lexer.l

tts_server_sample.c
tts_server_sample.h

The above two files contain the function definitions and function bodies of functions called from 
the parser.

These files can be renamed to remove the 'sample' part when they are used to implement an actual 
server.

Text-to-speech engine-specific functions called from the above should be contained in other source 
file(s).

Text-to-speech generating functions in those files can then be called from tts_server.c

As an example perhaps tts_espeak.(c|h) for the espeak software synthesiser.
