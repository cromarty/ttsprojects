emacspeak protocol parser using Flex and Bison
==============================================

Files:

emacspeak.y
emacspeak.l
tts_engine_sample.h
module_sample.c

The file tts_engine_sample.h contains the definition of every function called in the Bison parser 
and it should be renamed to tts_engine.h before use, and after copying it to the development source 
directory for a tts module.

The file module_sample.c is an example C file with one function per Emacspeak TTS protocol function. 
It should be copied into the development directory of the module you intend to write and renamed 
accordingly.




Bison
-----

To produce C files from the Bison grammar:

	bison -d emacspeak.y

The above will produce:

emacspeak.tab.c
emacspeak.tab.h

Flex
----

To produce a lexer from emacspeak.l:

flex emacspeak.l

Which produces:

lex.yy.c
