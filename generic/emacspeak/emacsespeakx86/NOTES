Notes
=====

This is an emacspeak text-to-speech server built around my Flex and Bison based protocol parser.

Files
-----

Most importantly:

src/parser.y		The bison parser
src/lexer.l		the flex lexer

Those files are contained elsewhere in the repository which contains this code and are soft-linked 
into this source tree and others.

Other files
-----------

src/tts_server.c and src/tts_server.h

The above files are the files which contain the function definitions and function bodies which are 
called from the parser.

src/tts_espeak.c and src/tts_espeak.h

The above two files contain code specific to the use of the espeak software speech-synthesiser.



src/list.(c|h) and src/queue.(c|h)

Source to implement a queue of speech fragments read from the emacspeak stream.

All other files are autoconf and automake related and/or are documentation.
