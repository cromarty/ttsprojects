Of course thanks to TV Raman over all for emacspeak.

Thanks to Kyle Loudon for:

Mastering Algorithms with C, Copyright (R) O'Reilly Media Inc.

ISBN-13: 978-1-565-92453-6

From where I took the code for creating a queue.

John R Levine for:

Flex and Bison, Copyright(C) O'Reilly Inc.

ISBN-9780596155971

Thanks to Fernando of the F123 Project, who gave me the impetus to finish a stagnant project to use 
Flex and Bison to generate an emacspeak protocol parser from which I could build all kinds of 
emacspeak text-to-speech servers, and for giving me a project I could use to learn Flex and Bison.

Hopefully coming up:

* Dolphin Apollo II
* Dolphin Juno
* DECTalk external
