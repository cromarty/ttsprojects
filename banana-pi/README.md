Nothing yet.

The Banana Pi, despite bing dual-core and having other stuff about it which make it better than a 
Raspberry Pi (1st gen) in many ways, it has a far inferior GPU and OpenGL, OpenMAX and some other 
hardware acceleration libs are not yet ported to it.

And now since the Pi2, which is quad-core ARMv7, the Banana Pi is a bit of a damp squib.

speakup and espeakup don't stutter like they do using eSpeak on the RPI but the last syllable is 
very badly clipped and although I have tried code tweaks to fix it I have so far failed.

My Banana Pi is currently relegated to being an internet radio.
